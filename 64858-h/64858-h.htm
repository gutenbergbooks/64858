</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seems useful, in presenting to English readers
this selection of the works of Voltaire, to recall
the position and personality of the writer and the
circumstances in which the works were written. It
is too lightly assumed, even by many who enjoy the
freedom which he, more than any, won for Europe,
and who may surpass him in scepticism, that Voltaire
is a figure to be left in a discreetly remote
niche of memory. “Other times, other manners”
is one of the phrases he contributed to modern
literature. Let us genially acknowledge that he
played a great part in dispelling the last mists of
the Middle Ages, and politely attribute to the papal
perversity and the lingering vulgarity of his age
the more effective features of his work. Thus has
Voltaire become a mere name to modern rationalists;
a name of fading brilliance, a monumental
name, but nothing more.</p>

<p>This sentiment is at once the effect and the cause
of a very general ignorance concerning Voltaire;
and it is a reproach to us. We have time, amid
increasing knowledge, to recover the most obscure
personalities of the Middle Ages and of antiquity;
we trace the most elementary contributors to modern
culture; and we neglect one of the mightiest forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
that made the development of modern culture possible.
I do not speak of Voltaire the historian,
who, a distinguished writer says, introduced history
for the first time into the realm of letters; Voltaire
the dramatist, whose name is inscribed for ever in
the temple of the tragic muse; Voltaire the physicist,
who drove the old Cartesianism out of France, and
imposed on it the fertile principles of Newton; Voltaire
the social reformer, who talked to eighteenth-century
kings of the rights of man, and scourged
every judicial criminal of his aristocratic age; Voltaire
the cosmopolitan, who boldly set up England’s
ensign of liberty in feudal France. All these things
were done by the “flippant Voltaire” of the flippant
modern preacher. But he can be considered here
only as one of the few who, in an age of profound
inequality, used the privilege of his enlightenment
to enlighten his fellows; one of those who won for
us that liberty to think rationally, and to speak
freely, on religious matters which we too airily
attribute to our new goddess, Evolution.</p>

<p>The position of Voltaire in the development of
religious thought in Europe is unique. Even if his
words had no application in our age, it merits the
most grateful consideration. Trace to its sources
the spirit that has led modern France and modern
Portugal to raise civic ideals above creeds, and
that will, within a few decades, find the same expression
in Spain, Italy, Belgium, and half of
America. You find yourself in the first half of the
nineteenth century, when, in all those countries, a
few hundred men, and some women, maintained a
superb struggle with restored monarchs and restored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span>
Jesuits for the liberty that had been wrested from
them; and you find that the vast majority of them
were disciples of Voltaire. Go back to the very
beginning of the anti-clerical movement; seek the
generators of that intellectual and emotional
electricity which, gathering insensibly in the atmosphere
of Europe in the second half of the eighteenth
century, burst at last in the lurid flashes and the
rolling thunders of the Great Revolution. On the
religious side, with which alone I am concerned
here, that devastating storm was overwhelmingly
due to the writings of Voltaire. Rousseau, it is
true, gave to the world his simple Deistic creed,
and with sweet reasonableness lodged it in the
minds of many; Diderot and d’Holbach and La
Mettrie impressed their deeper scepticism with a
weight of learning. But Voltaire was the oracle of
Europe. “I have no sceptre, but I have a pen,” he
once said to Frederick the Great. And when, in his
later years, he poured out from his remote château
on the Swiss frontier the flood of satires, stories,
sermons, dialogues, pamphlets, and treatises which
ate deep into the fabric of old Europe, his pen
proved mightier than all the sceptres of its kings.
To ignore Voltaire is to ignore history.</p>

<p>My object, however, in introducing to English
readers these few characteristic specimens of his
anti-clerical work is not solely to bespeak some
gratefulness for the toleration and freedom which
he enforced on a reluctant world, or to gratify a
simple curiosity as to the character of his power.
These are not dead words, not ashes of an extinct
fire, which we disinter; for the world is not dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
at which they were flung. If they cause resentment
in the minds of some, the publication will be the
more justified. But before I explain this paradox,
let me show how the works came to be written, and
written in such a way.</p>

<p>The life of Voltaire, which some conceive as a
prolonged adolescence, has a very clear and instructive
division into adolescence, manhood, and ripe
age. All the works given in this volume belong to
the last part, but we must glance at the others.
François Marie Arouet was born, in the very comfortable
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</i> family of a staid Parisian notary,
in 1694. He became a precocious, sharp-eared boy.
His godfather was an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abbé</i>, a kind of ecclesiastic&mdash;not
usually a priest&mdash;in the France of the time
who drew his income from the Church, and therefore
felt more entitled than the ordinary layman
to scoff at its dogmas and ignore its morals. He
could plead the example of his bishops. Several
of these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abbés</i> visited the home of the Arouets, and
gave little “Zozo” his first lessons in Biblical criticism.
In the great college of the Jesuits he learned
to articulate his scepticism. In his seventeenth
year he set out on the career of letters. The kindly
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abbé</i>, who, having answered to God for him at the
baptismal font, felt bound to guide his fortunes,
introduced him to one of the most brilliant and
dissolute circles in Paris. It was a kind of club
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abbés</i>, nobles, writers, etc., and in it he would
rapidly attain that large and peculiar knowledge
of the Old Testament which appears in his writings.
He sparkled so much at the suppers of the Epicureans,
and earned such reputation, that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
put in the Bastille for certain naughty epigrams,
which he had not written; and he was exiled for
another epigram, on a distinguished sinner, which
he had written. In the pensive solitude of the
Bastille he changed his name to Voltaire.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He emerged
bolder than ever, wrote tragedies and poems and
epigrams, was welcomed in the smartest salons of
Paris, and behaved as a young gentleman of the
time was expected to behave, until his thirty-first
year.</p>

<p>In 1726 he was, through the despotic and most
unjust action of a powerful noble, again put in the
Bastille, and was then allowed to exchange that
fortress for the fogs of London. Up to this time
he had no idea of attacking Church or State. He
had, in 1722, written a letter on religion&mdash;in the
vein, apparently, of some of Swinburne’s unpublished
juvenilia&mdash;which a distinguished writer of the
time, to whom he read it, described as “making his
hair stand on end”; it was, however, not intended
for circulation. But experience of England, for
which he contracted a passionate admiration, and
which (as Mr. Churton Collins has shown) he
studied profoundly, sobered him with a high and
serious purpose. He met all the brilliant writers
of that age in England, and took a great interest
in the religious controversy which raged over Anthony
Collins’s <cite>Discourse</cite>. He returned to France
in 1729, vowing to win for it the liberty and enlightenment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
he had enjoyed in England. The splendid
<cite>English Letters</cite> which he wrote with that aim,
and was afraid to publish, leaked out in 1734. The
book was burned by the hangman, and he had to
retire once more, for letting France know how enlightened
England was in the days of George I.</p>

<p>I pass over twenty years of his strenuous and brilliant
career. He wrote his most famous tragedies
and histories; he made an ardent study of, and
introduced to France, the new science of Isaac Newton,
whose funeral he had witnessed in London; he
was banished from his country for smiling at Adam
and Eve; he deserted France for Germany, and then
quarrelled with Frederick the Great; he tried liberal
Switzerland, and found that it gave you liberty
only to attack other people’s dogmas; and in 1760
he settled at Ferney, since the shrine of Continental
Rationalism, on the frontier, so that he could talk
to Calvinists from the French side, and cross the
border, if need were, to talk to France. But France
was at his feet. For eighteen years more he showered
his rain of publications on it. Even in those
illiterate days some of his publications sold 300,000
copies. And when at last, in 1778, he was tempted
to revisit Paris, the roar of delight, of esteem, of
abject worship, overwhelmed him, and he died in
a flood of glory.</p>

<p>To those last twenty years of his life belong the
anti-Christian works reproduced in this volume.
He was now a man of mature judgment, vast erudition,
and grave humanitarian purpose. The common
notion in England of Voltaire’s works, as superficial
gibes thrown out by the way in a brilliant career,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
is sheer nonsense. His command of history was
remarkable; and he had, for the time, a thorough
grasp of science and philosophy. His arguments for
the existence of God will compare with those of the
ablest lay or clerical theologians of his time. His
knowledge was defective and inaccurate because all
knowledge was defective and inaccurate in the eighteenth
century, when research was only just beginning
to recover from its long ecclesiastical paralysis.
No man in France had a larger command of such
knowledge as the time afforded, and the use he made
of it was serious and high-purposed. It is only the
superficial who cannot see the depth below that
sparkling surface; only the insensible who cannot
feel the strong, steady beat of a human heart behind
the rippling laughter.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Écrasez l’infame</i>&mdash;“Crush the infamous thing”&mdash;the
battle-cry which he sent over Europe from the
Swiss frontier, was but a fiery expression of his
love of men, of liberty, of enlightenment, and of
progress. Read the stories of brutality in the guise
of religion that are told in these pages&mdash;stories
which ran into Voltaire’s day&mdash;the stories of “religious”
processions and relics and superstitions,
the story of how this ignorant credulity had been
imposed on Europe, and how it was maintained by
sceptical priests, and say, if you dare, that the phrase
was not a cry of truth, sincerity, and humanity.
There was even a profoundly religious impulse in
his work. A clerical friend once confided to me that
he found a use in Voltaire. It seemed that, when
inspiration for the Sunday sermon failed, he fell
upon my “atheistic friends,” Voltaire and Rousseau,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
and the French Revolution they brought about. He
was amazed to hear that they believed in God as
firmly as, and much more reasonably than, he and
his colleagues did. Voltaire’s aim was a sincere
effort to rid pure religion of its morbid and abominable
overgrowths.</p>

<p>Very good, you say; but why not have set about
it more politely? For two plain reasons. First,
because the character of his opponents fully justified
him in directing his most scathing wit upon them.
The Jesuits, whom he chiefly lashed, were in his own
time ignominiously expelled by nearly every Catholic
Power in Europe, and were suppressed by the Pope.
The other clergy were deeply tainted with scepticism
in the cities, and befogged with dense ignorance in
the provinces. One incident will suffice to justify
his disdain. His latest English biographer, S. G.
Tallentyre, who is not biassed in his favour, says
that it is most probable, if not certain, that while
the Catholic authorities were burning his books in
Paris, and shuddering at his infidelity, they were
secretly tempting him, with the prospect of a cardinal’s
hat, to join the clergy. It is certain that
they invited him to do religious work, and that, at
the height of his anti-clerical work, he received
direct from the Pope certain relics to put in a
chapel he had built for his poor neighbours. Could
a prince of irony restrain himself in such circumstances?
The other reason is the character of the
dogmas and practices he assailed. Read them in
the following pages.</p>

<p>It is true that there are passages in Voltaire
which none of us would, if we could, write to-day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
The taste of the eighteenth century, still fouled by
the Middle Ages, is not the taste of the twentieth.
Besides some longer passages which have been
omitted from the <cite>Treatise on Toleration</cite>, as will
be explained, a few lines have been struck out or
modified here and there in one or two of the works
in this selection. Let me not be misunderstood,
however. They are mainly words of the Old Testament,
and comments inspired only by those words,
that have been omitted. In the eighteenth century
one could quote and comment in public on these
grossnesses. Indeed, by some singular mental process,
which Voltaire alone could characterise, the
books containing these crudely sexual passages are
still thrust into the hands of children and of confined
criminals by the joint authority of Church
and State in England; and grave bishops and gentle
women say that they are the Word of God.</p>

<p>And this brings me to the last point that I desire
to touch before I introduce, one by one, the works
contained in this volume. Why reproduce at all, in
the twentieth century, these fitting scourges of the
superstitions of the eighteenth? I have said that
they deserve to be reproduced for their historical
interest and for the great part they have played in
the history of Europe; but there is another reason.
I have an idea that, if Voltaire were alive in England
to-day, he would write with more scathing
irony than ever. I imagine him gazing with profound
admiration at that marvellous picture of the
past which science and archæology have given us,
and then asking at what date in the nineteenth
century we ceased to dispute about consubstantiality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
and transubstantiation, took the gilt off our
Old Testament, and elevated our bishops to the
rank of citizens. I then fancy him peeping into
the fine schools of London or Manchester, and learning
that the first educational authorities in England
still set children to learn about Adam and
Eve, the Deluge, the Plagues of Egypt, and the remarkable
proceedings of Joshua and David and the
rest. I try to conceive him studying the faces of
learned judges and professors, as they listen gravely
to the reading of the Bible and the creeds in church
on Sundays, or reverently handle the book in court.
I picture his amazement as he learns that this England,
which he thought so enlightened, still, at the
dictation of its bishops, retains the most abominable
divorce law in the civilised world; or hears preachers
and social students seriously expressing concern
for the future of Europe on account of the decay
of docility to the clergy. What would he have
written on such a situation?</p>

<p>The satire of Voltaire is not out of place in modern
England. As long as the Bible is, however insincerely,
pressed on us as the Word of God, and
retained in our schools, we are compelled to point
out in it features which make such claims ludicrous.
As long as the clergy maintain that their rule in
the past was a benefit to civilisation, and therefore
its decay may be a menace to civilisation, we are
bound to tell the ugly truth in regard to the past.
As long as educated men and women among us profess
a belief in the magic of transubstantiation and
auricular confession and miracles, and the uneducated
are encouraged to believe these things literally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
the irony of Voltaire is legitimate. Christian bodies
have, of late years, made repeated attempts to induce
our leaders of culture to profess the Christian
faith. The issue has been to make it clear that the
great majority of our professors, distinguished
writers, and artists hold either the simple theism
of Voltaire or discard even that. The doctrines
attacked here by Voltaire are wholly discredited.
Yet they are still the official teaching of the
Churches (except of the Congregationalists); they
are largely enforced on innocent children, and they
are literally accepted by some millions of our people.
I see no reason to refrain from letting the
irony of Voltaire fall on them once more.</p>

<p>The reader must not, however, conclude at once
that the following pages are so many red-hot charges
into the tottering ranks of mediæval dogmas. My
aim has been to illustrate the versatility of Voltaire’s
genius, and to exhibit his own sincere creed
no less than his most penetrating scourges of what
most educated men in his time and ours regard as
utterly antiquated delusions. There are pages here
that might receive a place of honour in the most
orthodox religious journals of England; other pages
in which the irony is so subtle and the temper so
polite that, without the terrible name, they would
puzzle many a clergyman. In the <cite>Questions of
Zapata</cite>, however, and in parts of one or two other
essays, I have given specimens of the Voltaire who
was likened to Antichrist.</p>

<p>The selection opens with the <cite>Treatise on Toleration</cite>,
which has a mainly historical interest, and
illustrates the finest side of Voltaire’s work and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
character. It shows him as a profound humanitarian,
putting aside, in his seventieth year, his laughter
and his comfort to take up the cause of an obscure
sufferer, and shaking France, as Zola did in our
time, with his denunciation of a judicial crime. The
story of the crime is told in the essay itself; but
it is not told, or in any way conveyed, that, but for
the action of the aged rationalist, not a single effort
would have been made to secure redress. His splendid
action on that and a few similar occasions has
been held by critical students of his career to atone
for all his errors. Many Protestants who scoff at
“Voltaire the scoffer” may learn with surprise that
his noble and impassioned struggle earned for them
the right to live in Southern France. The treatise
was published in 1763. I have omitted a number
of lengthy and learned notes and one or two chapters
which are incidental to the argument and of
little interest to-day.</p>

<p>The three Homilies&mdash;those <cite>On Superstition</cite>, <cite>On
the Interpretation of the Old Testament</cite>, and <cite>On
the Interpretation of the New Testament</cite>&mdash;are
selected from five which Voltaire wrote in 1767,
with the literary pretence that they had been delivered
before some liberal congregation at London
in 1765. The second of these Homilies is one of
the most effective indictments of the Old Testament,
considered as an inspired book. Nowhere in rationalistic
literature is there an exposure of the essential
humanity of the Old Testament so condensed yet
so fluent, so original in form, comprehensive in
range, and unanswerable in argument. It was published,
it is believed, in 1767, though the first edition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
is marked 1766. Its humour is malicious from the
first line, as the “Dr. Tamponet” whose name is
put to it was really an orthodox champion of the
Sorbonne. It is in this short diatribe that I have
chiefly made the modifications of which I have
spoken. It was Voltaire’s aim to show that the
coarseness of many passages of the Old Testament
is quite as inconsistent with inspiration as its
colossal inaccuracy and its childlike superstition.
An English translation, similarly modified, of the
<cite>Questions of Zapata</cite> was made by an anonymous
lady, and published by Hetherington, in 1840. In
the present translation some of the paragraphs are
omitted, and the numbering is therefore altered.</p>

<p>The <cite>Epistle to the Romans</cite>, another specimen of
Voltaire’s most deadly polemic, is a just and masterly
indictment of the papal system. It was issued
in 1768, and very promptly put on the Index by
the outraged Vatican. But it penetrated educated
Italy, and had no small share in the enlightenment
which has ended in the emancipation of the country.
The exquisite imitations of sermons which
follow contain some of Voltaire’s most insidious
and delicate irony. The <cite>Sermon of the Fifty</cite> was
written and published in 1762.</p>

<p>The volume closes with the famous poem which
Voltaire wrote, in the year 1755, when he heard that
an earthquake had destroyed between 30,000 and
40,000 people in Portugal. It was one of the chief
festivals of the Catholic year, the Feast of All
Saints (November 1), and the crowded churches were
in the very act of worship, when the ground shook.
In a few minutes 16,000 men, women, and children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
were slain, and as many more perished in the
subsequent fires and horrors. Voltaire was at Geneva,
and the horrible news threw him into the deepest
distress. The poem into which he condensed his
pain and his doubts is not a leisurely and polished
piece of art. It has technical defects, and is unequal
in inspiration. Should we admire it if it
were otherwise? But it is a fine monument to his
sincerity and just human passion, and it contains
some phrases that became proverbial and some passages
of great beauty. I have altered the structure
of the verse&mdash;the original is in rhymed hexameters&mdash;only
in order that I could more faithfully convey
to those who read only English the sentiments
and, as far as possible, the phrasing of Voltaire.
One allusion that recurs throughout needs some
explanation. Browning’s “All’s right with the
world” was a very familiar cry in the eighteenth
century. The English Deists, and J. J. Rousseau
in France, held obstinately to this most singular
optimism. Although Rousseau made a feeble and
friendly reply to the poem, it proved a deadly blow
to his somewhat fantastic teaching on that point.</p>

<p>Immediately preceding this poem I have given a
translation of Voltaire’s philosophical essay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il
faut choisir</i>. This was written by him in 1772, six
years before his death, and is the most succinct
expression of his mature religious views. It is
really directed against his atheistic friends at
Paris, such as d’Holbach. Condorcet said of it
that it contained the most powerful argumentation
for the existence of God that had yet been advanced.
Its remarkable lucidity and terseness enable us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>
identify his views at once. He did not believe in
the spirituality or immortality of the soul, but he
had an unshakable conviction of the existence of
God. It is sometimes said that the Lisbon earthquake
shook his theism. This is inaccurate, as a
careful comparison of the two works will show.
He never believed that the supreme intelligence was
infinite in power, and the haunting problem of evil
always made him hesitate to ascribe more than
limited moral attributes to his deity. His one unwavering
dogma&mdash;it does not waver for an instant
in the poem&mdash;is that the world was designed by a
supreme intelligence and is moved by a supreme
power. Had he lived one hundred years later, when
evolution began to throw its magical illumination
upon the order of the universe and the wonderful
adaptation of its parts, his position would clearly
have been modified. As it was, he, with constant
sincerity, avowed that he could not understand the
world without a great architect and a prime mover
of all moving things. In all his works the uglier
features of the world, which, unlike many theists,
he steadfastly confronted, forbid him to add any
other and warmer attributes to this bleak intelligence
and mysterious power.</p>

<h3 class="allsmcap">SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF JEAN CALAS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> murder of Calas, which was perpetrated with
the sword of justice at Toulouse on March 9,
1762, is one of the most singular events that
deserve the attention of our own and of later
ages. We quickly forget the long list of the dead
who have perished in our battles. It is the inevitable
fate of war; those who die by the sword
might themselves have inflicted death on their
enemies, and did not die without the means of
defending themselves. When the risk and the advantage
are equal astonishment ceases, and even pity
is enfeebled. But when an innocent father is given
into the hands of error, of passion, or of fanaticism;
when the accused has no defence but his virtue;
when those who dispose of his life run no risk but
that of making a mistake; when they can slay with
impunity by a legal decree&mdash;then the voice of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
general public is heard, and each fears for himself.
They see that no man’s life is safe before a court
that has been set up to guard the welfare of citizens,
and every voice is raised in a demand of
vengeance.</p>

<p>In this strange incident we have to deal with
religion, suicide, and parricide. The question was,
Whether a father and mother had strangled their
son to please God, a brother had strangled his
brother, and a friend had strangled his friend; or
whether the judges had incurred the reproach of
breaking on the wheel an innocent father, or of
sparing a guilty mother, brother, and friend.</p>

<p>Jean Calas, a man of sixty-eight years, had been
engaged in commerce at Toulouse for more than
forty years, and was recognised by all who knew
him as a good father. He was a Protestant,
as were also his wife and family, except one
son, who had abjured the heresy, and was in
receipt of a small allowance from his father. He
seemed to be so far removed from the absurd fanaticism
that breaks the bonds of society that he had
approved the conversion of his son [Louis Calas],
and had had in his service for thirty years a zealous
Catholic woman, who had reared all his children.</p>

<p>One of the sons of Jean Calas, named Marc
Antoine, was a man of letters. He was regarded
as of a restless, sombre, and violent character. This
young man, failing to enter the commercial world,
for which he was unfitted, or the legal world,
because he could not obtain the necessary certificate
that he was a Catholic, determined to end his life,
and informed a friend of his intention. He strengthened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
his resolution by reading all that has ever
been written on suicide.</p>

<p>Having one day lost his money in gambling, he
determined to carry out his plan on that very day.
A personal friend and friend of the family, named
Lavaisse, a young man of nineteen, well known for
his candid and kindly ways, the son of a distinguished
lawyer at Toulouse, had come from Bordeaux
on the previous day, October 12, 1761. He
happened to sup with the Calas family. The father,
mother, Marc Antoine, the elder son, and Pierre,
the second son, were present. After supper they
withdrew to a small room. Marc Antoine disappeared,
and when young Lavaisse was ready to go,
and he and Pierre Calas had gone down-stairs, they
found, near the shop below, Marc Antoine in his
shirt, hanging from a door, his coat folded under
the counter. His shirt was unruffled, his hair was
neatly combed, and he had no wound or mark on
the body.</p>

<p>We will omit the details which were given in
court, and the grief and despair of his parents;
their cries were heard by the neighbours. Lavaisse
and Pierre, beside themselves, ran for surgeons and
the police.</p>

<p>While they were doing this, and the father and
mother sobbed and wept, the people of Toulouse
gathered round the house. They are superstitious
and impulsive people; they regard as monsters their
brothers who do not share their religion. It was
at Toulouse that solemn thanks were offered to God
for the death of Henry III., and that an oath was
taken to kill any man who should propose to recognise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the great and good Henry IV. This city still
celebrates every year, by a procession and fireworks,
the day on which it massacred four thousand heretical
citizens two hundred years ago. Six decrees
of the Council have been passed in vain for the
suppression of this odious festival; the people of
Toulouse celebrate it still like a floral festival.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Some fanatic in the crowd cried out that Jean
Calas had hanged his son Marc Antoine. The cry
was soon repeated on all sides; some adding that
the deceased was to have abjured Protestantism on
the following day, and that the family and young
Lavaisse had strangled him out of hatred of the
Catholic religion. In a moment all doubt had disappeared.
The whole town was persuaded that it
is a point of religion with the Protestants for a
father and mother to kill their children when they
wish to change their faith.</p>

<p>The agitation could not end here. It was imagined
that the Protestants of Languedoc had held
a meeting the night before; that they had, by a
majority of votes, chosen an executioner for the
sect; that the choice had fallen on young Lavaisse;
and that, in the space of twenty-four hours, the
young man had received the news of his appointment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
and had come from Bordeaux to help Jean
Calas, his wife, and their son Pierre to strangle a
friend, son, and brother.</p>

<p>The captain of Toulouse, David, excited by these
rumours and wishing to give effect to them by a
prompt execution, took a step which is against the
laws and regulations. He put the Calas family, the
Catholic servant, and Lavaisse in irons.</p>

<p>A report not less vicious than his procedure was
published. He even went further. Marc Antoine
Calas had died a Calvinist; and, if he had taken
his own life, his body was supposed to be dragged
on a hurdle. Instead of this, he was buried with
great pomp in the church of St. Stephen, although
the priest protested against this profanation.</p>

<p>There are in Languedoc four confraternities of
penitents&mdash;the white, the blue, the grey, and the
black. Their members wear a long hood, with a
cloth mask, pierced with two holes for the eyes.
They endeavoured to induce the Duke of Fitz-James,
the governor of the province, to enter their ranks,
but he refused. The white penitents held a solemn
service over Marc Antoine Calas, as over a martyr.
No church ever celebrated the feast of a martyr
with more pomp; but it was a terrible pomp. They
had raised above a magnificent bier a skeleton, which
was made to move its bones. It represented Marc
Antoine Calas holding a palm in one hand, and in
the other the pen with which he was to sign his
abjuration of heresy. This pen, in-point of fact,
signed the death-sentence of his father.</p>

<p>The only thing that remained for the poor devil
who had taken his life was canonisation. Everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
regarded him as a saint; some invoked him,
others went to pray at his tomb, others sought
miracles of him, and others, again, related the
miracles he had wrought. A monk extracted some
of his teeth, to have permanent relics of him. A
pious woman, who was rather deaf, told how she
heard the sound of bells. An apoplectic priest was
cured, after taking an emetic. Legal declarations
of these prodigies were drawn up. The writer of
this account has in his possession the attestation
that a young man of Toulouse went mad because
he had prayed for several nights at the tomb of
the new saint, and could not obtain the miracle he
sought.</p>

<p>Some of the magistrates belonged to the confraternity
of white penitents. From that moment
the death of Jean Calas seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>What contributed most to his fate was the
approach of that singular festival which the people
of Toulouse hold every year in memory of the massacre
of four thousand Huguenots. The year 1762
was the bicentenary of the event. The city was
decorated with all the trappings of the ceremony,
and the heated imagination of the people was still
further excited. It was stated publicly that the
scaffold on which the Calas were to be executed
would be the chief ornament of the festival; it was
said that Providence itself provided these victims
for sacrifice in honour of our holy religion. A
score of people heard these, and even more violent
things. And this in our days&mdash;in an age when
philosophy has made so much progress, and a hundred
academies are writing for the improvement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
our morals! It would seem that fanaticism is
angry at the success of reason, and combats it more
furiously.</p>

<p>Thirteen judges met daily to bring the trial to
a close. There was not, and could not be, any evidence
against the family; but a deluded religion
took the place of proof. Six of the judges long
persisted in condemning Jean Calas, his son, and
Lavaisse to the wheel, and the wife of Jean Calas
to the stake. The other seven, more moderate,
wished at least to make an inquiry. The discussions
were long and frequent. One of the judges,
convinced that the accused were innocent and the
crime was impossible, spoke strongly on their
behalf. He opposed a zeal for humanity to the zeal
for severity, and became the public pleader for the
Calas in Toulouse, where the incessant cries of
outraged religion demanded the blood of the accused.
Another judge, known for his violent temper, spoke
against the Calas with the same spirit. At last,
amid great excitement, they both threw up the case
and retired to the country.</p>

<p>But by a singular misfortune the judge who was
favourable to the Calas had the delicacy to persist
in his resignation, and the other returned to condemn
those whom he could not judge. His voice
it was that drew up the condemnation to the wheel.
There were now eight votes to five, as one of the
six opposing judges had passed to the more severe
party after considerable discussion.</p>

<p>It seems that in a case of parricide, when a
father is to be condemned to the most frightful
death, the verdict ought to be unanimous, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
evidence for so rare a crime ought to be such as
to convince everybody.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The slightest doubt in such
a case should intimidate a judge who is to sign the
death-sentence. The weakness of our reason and its
inadequacy are shown daily; and what greater proof
of it can we have than when we find a citizen condemned
to the wheel by a majority of one vote?
In ancient Athens there had to be fifty votes above
the half to secure a sentence of death. It shows
us, most unprofitably, that the Greeks were wiser
and more humane than we.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that Jean Calas, an old man
of sixty-eight years, whose limbs had long been
swollen and weak, had been able to strangle and
hang a young man in his twenty-eighth year, above
the average in strength. It seemed certain that he
must have been assisted in the murder by his wife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
his son Pierre, Lavaisse, and the servant. They had
not left each other’s company for an instant on the
evening of the fatal event. But this supposition was
just as absurd as the other. How could a zealous
Catholic servant allow Huguenots to kill a young
man, reared by herself, to punish him for embracing
her own religion? How could Lavaisse have come
expressly from Bordeaux to strangle his friend,
whose conversion was unknown to him? How
could a tender mother lay hands on her son? How
could the whole of them together strangle a young
man who was stronger than all of them without a
long and violent struggle, without cries that would
have aroused the neighbours, without repeated blows
and torn garments?</p>

<p>It was evident that, if there had been any crime,
all the accused were equally guilty, as they had
never left each other for a moment; it was evident
that they were not all guilty; and it was evident
that the father alone could not have done it.
Nevertheless, the father alone was condemned to the wheel.</p>

<p>The reason of the sentence was as inconceivable
as all the rest. The judges, who were bent on
executing Jean Calas, persuaded the others that the
weak old man could not endure the torture, and
would on the scaffold confess his crime and accuse
his accomplices. They were confounded when the
old man, expiring on the wheel, prayed God to
witness his innocence, and begged him to pardon
his judges.</p>

<p>They were compelled to pass a second sentence
in contradiction of the first, and to set free the
mother, the son Pierre, the young Lavaisse, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the servant; but one of the councillors pointing out
that this verdict gave the lie to the other, that
they were condemning themselves, and that, as the
accused were all together at the supposed hour of
the crime, the acquittal of the survivors necessarily
proved the innocence of the dead father, they
decided to banish Pierre Calas. This banishment
seemed as illogical and absurd as all the rest.
Pierre Calas was either guilty or innocent. If he
was guilty, he should be broken on the wheel like
his father; if he was innocent, they had no right
to banish him. However, the judges, terrified by
the execution of the father and the touching piety
of his end, thought they were saving their honour
by affecting to pardon the son, as if it were not
a fresh prevarication to pardon him; and they
thought that the banishment of this poor and helpless
young man was not a great injustice after
that they had already committed.</p>

<p>They began with threatening Pierre Calas, in his
dungeon, that he would suffer like his father if he
did not renounce his religion. The young man
attests this on oath: “A Dominican monk came to
my cell and threatened me with the same kind of
death if I did not give up my religion.”</p>

<p>Pierre Calas, on leaving the city, met a priest,
who compelled him to return to Toulouse. They
confined him in a Dominican convent, and forced
him to perform Catholic functions. It was part of
what they wanted. It was the price of his father’s
blood, and religion seemed to be avenged.</p>

<p>The daughters were taken from the mother and
put in a convent. The mother, almost sprinkled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
with the blood of her husband, her eldest son dead,
the younger banished, deprived of her daughters
and all her property, was alone in the world, without
bread, without hope, dying of the intolerable
misery. Certain persons, having carefully examined
the circumstances of this horrible adventure,
were so impressed that they urged the widow, who
had retired into solitude, to go and demand justice
at the feet of the throne.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At the time she shrank
from publicity; moreover, being English by birth,
and having been transplanted into a French province
in early youth, the name of Paris terrified her.
She imagined that the capital of the kingdom would
be still more barbaric than the capital of Languedoc.
At length the duty of clearing the memory of her
husband prevailed over her weakness. She reached
Paris almost at the point of death. She was astonished
at her reception, at the help and the tears
that were given to her.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>At Paris reason dominates fanaticism, however
powerful it be; in the provinces fanaticism almost
always overcomes reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>M. de Beaumont, the famous advocate of the
Parlement de Paris, undertook to defend her, and
drew up a memorial signed by fifteen other advocates.
M. Loiseau, not less eloquent, drew up a
memoir on behalf of the family. M. Mariette, an
advocate of the Council, drew up a judicial inquiry
which brought conviction to every mind. These
three generous defenders of the laws of innocence
gave to the widow the profit on the sale of their
memoirs. Paris and the whole of Europe were
moved with pity, and demanded justice for the
unfortunate woman. The verdict was given by the
public long before it was signed by the Council.</p>

<p>The spirit of pity penetrated the ministry, in spite
of the torrent of business that so often shuts out
pity, and in spite of that daily sight of misery that
does even more to harden the heart. The daughters
were restored to their mother. As they sat, clothed
in crape and bathed in tears, their judges were seen
to weep.</p>

<p>They had still enemies, however, for it was a
question of religion. Many of those people who are
known in France as “devout”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> said openly that
it was much better to let an innocent old Calvinist
be slain than to compel eight Councillors of Languedoc
to admit that they were wrong. One even
heard such phrases as “There are more magistrates
than Calas”; and it was inferred that the Calas
family ought to be sacrificed to the honour of the
magistrates. They did not reflect that the honour
of judges, like that of other men, consists in repairing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
their blunders. It is not believed in France
that the Pope is infallible, even with the assistance
of his cardinals<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; we might just as well admit that
eight judges of Toulouse are not. All other people,
more reasonable and disinterested, said that the
Toulouse verdict would be reversed all over Europe,
even if special considerations prevented it from
being reversed by the Council.</p>

<p>Such was the position of this astonishing adventure
when it moved certain impartial and reasonable
persons to submit to the public a few reflections on
the subject of toleration, indulgence, and pity, which
the Abbé Houteville calls “a monstrous dogma,” in
his garbled version of the facts, and which reason
calls an “appanage of nature.”</p>

<p>Either the judges of Toulouse, swept away by the
fanaticism of the people, have broken on the wheel
an innocent man, which is unprecedented; or the
father and his wife strangled their elder son, with
the assistance of another son and a friend, which
is unnatural. In either case the abuse of religion
has led to a great crime. It is, therefore, of interest
to the race to inquire whether religion ought to be
charitable or barbaric.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">CONSEQUENCES OF THE EXECUTION OF JEAN CALAS</h3>

<p>If the white penitents were the cause of the
execution of an innocent man, the utter ruin of a
family, and the dispersal and humiliation that attach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
to an execution, though they should punish only
injustice; if the haste of the white penitents to
commemorate as a saint one who, according to our
barbaric customs, should have been dragged on a
hurdle, led to the execution of a virtuous parent;
they ought indeed to be penitents for the rest of
their lives. They and the judges should weep, but
not in a long white robe, and with no mask to hide
their tears.</p>

<p>We respect all confraternities; they are edifying.
But can whatever good they may do the State outweigh
this appalling evil that they have done? It
seems that they have been established by the zeal
which in Languedoc fires the Catholics against those
whom we call Huguenots. One would say that they
had taken vows to hate their brothers; for we have
religion enough left to hate and to persecute, and
we have enough to love and to help. What would
happen if these confraternities were controlled by
enthusiasts, as were once certain congregations of
artisans and “gentlemen,” among whom, as one of
our most eloquent and learned magistrates said, the
seeing of visions was reduced to a fine art? What
would happen if these confraternities set up again
those dark chambers, called “meditation rooms,”
on which were painted devils armed with horns
and claws, gulfs of flame, crosses and daggers, with
the holy name of Jesus surmounting the picture?<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
What a spectacle for eyes that are already fascinated,
and imaginations that are as inflamed as
they are submissive to their confessors!</p>

<p>There have been times when, as we know only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
too well, confraternities were dangerous. The Fratelli
and the Flagellants gave trouble enough. The
League<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> began with associations of that kind. Why
should they distinguish themselves thus from other
citizens? Did they think themselves more perfect?
The very claim is an insult to the rest of the nation.
Did they wish all Christians to enter their confraternity?
What a sight it would be to have all
Europe in hoods and masks, with two little round
holes in front of the eyes! Do they seriously think
that God prefers this costume to that of ordinary
folk? Further, this garment is the uniform of
controversialists, warning their opponents to get to
arms. It may excite a kind of civil war of minds,
and would perhaps end in fatal excesses, unless the
king and his ministers were as wise as the fanatics
were demented.</p>

<p>We know well what the price has been ever since
Christians began to dispute about dogmas. Blood
has flowed, on scaffolds and in battles, from the
fourth century to our own days.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> We will restrict
ourselves here to the wars and horrors which the
Reformation struggle caused, and see what was the
source of them in France. Possibly a short and
faithful account of those calamities will open the
eyes of the uninformed and touch the hearts of the
humane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">THE IDEA OF THE REFORMATION</h3>

<p>When enlightenment spread, with the renaissance
of letters in the fifteenth century, there was a very
general complaint of abuses, and everybody agrees
that the complaint was just.</p>

<p>Pope Alexander VI. had openly bought the papal
tiara, and his five bastards shared its advantages.
His son, the cardinal-duke of Borgia, made an end,
in concert with his father, of Vitelli, Urbino, Gravina,
Oliveretto, and a hundred other nobles, in
order to seize their lands. Julius II., animated by
the same spirit, excommunicated Louis XII. and
gave his kingdom to the first occupant; while he
himself, helmet on head and cuirass on back,
spread blood and fire over part of Italy. Leo X.,
to pay for his pleasures, sold indulgences, as the
taxes are sold in the open market. They who revolted
against this brigandage were, at least, not
wrong from the moral point of view. Let us see
if they were wrong in politics.</p>

<p>They said that, since Jesus Christ had never exacted
fees, nor sold dispensations for this world or
indulgences for the next, one might refuse to pay
a foreign prince the price of these things. Supposing
that our fees to Rome and the dispensations
which we still buy<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> did not cost us more than
five hundred thousand francs a year, it is clear that,
since the time of Francis I., we should have paid,
in two hundred and fifty years, a hundred and
twenty million francs; allowing for the change of
value in money, we may say about two hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
fifty millions [£10,000,000]. One may, therefore,
without blasphemy, admit that the heretics, in proposing
to abolish these singular taxes, which will
astonish a later age, did not do a very grave wrong
to the kingdom, and that they were rather good
financiers than bad subjects. Let us add that they
alone knew Greek, and were acquainted with antiquity.
Let us grant that, in spite of their errors,
we owe to them the development of the human
mind, so long buried in the densest barbarism.</p>

<p>But, as they denied the existence of Purgatory,
which it is not permitted to doubt, and which
brought a considerable income to the monks; and
as they did not venerate relics, which ought to be
venerated, and which are a source of even greater
profit&mdash;in fine, as they assailed much-respected
dogmas, the only answer to them at first was to
burn them. The king, who protected and subsidised
them in Germany, walked at the head of a procession
in Paris, and at the close a number of the
wretches were executed. This was the manner of
execution. They were hung at the end of a long
beam, which was balanced, like a see-saw, across
a tree. A big fire was lit underneath, and they
were alternately sunk into it and raised out. Their
torments were thus protracted, until death relieved
them from a more hideous punishment than any
barbarian had ever invented.</p>

<p>Shortly before the death of Francis I. certain
members of the Parlement de Provence, instigated
by their clergy against the inhabitants of Merindol
and Cabrières, asked the king for troops to support
the execution of nineteen persons of the district<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
whom they had condemned. They had six thousand
slain, without regard to sex or age or infancy, and
they reduced thirty towns to ashes. These people,
who had not hitherto been heard of, were, no doubt,
in the wrong to have been born Waldensians; but
that was their only crime. They had been settled
for three hundred years in the deserts and on
the mountains, which they had, with incredible
labour, made fertile. Their quiet, pastoral life
represented the supposed innocence of the first
ages of men. They knew the neighbouring towns
only by selling fruit to them. They had no law-courts
and never warred; they did not defend
themselves. They were slain as one slays animals
in an enclosure.</p>

<p>After the death of Francis I.&mdash;a prince who is
better known for his amours and misfortunes than
his cruelty&mdash;the execution of a thousand heretics,
especially of the Councillor of the Parlement, Dubourg,
and the massacre of Vassy, caused the persecuted
sect to take to arms. They had increased
in the light of the flames and under the sword of
the executioner, and substituted fury for patience.
They imitated the cruelties of their enemies. Nine
civil wars filled France with carnage; and a peace
more fatal than war led to the massacre of St.
Bartholomew, which is without precedent in the
annals of crime.</p>

<p>The [Catholic] League assassinated Henry III.
and Henry IV. by the hands of a Dominican monk,
and of a monster who had belonged to the order of
St. Bernard. There are those who say that humanity,
indulgence, and liberty of conscience are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
horrible things. Candidly, could they have brought
about calamities such as these?</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">WHETHER TOLERATION IS DANGEROUS, AND AMONG<br />
WHAT PEOPLES IT IS FOUND</h3>

<p>There are some who say that, if we treated with
paternal indulgence those erring brethren who pray
to God in bad French [instead of bad Latin], we
should be putting weapons in their hands, and would
once more witness the battles of Jarnac, Moncontour,
Coutras, Dreux, and St. Denis. I do not
know anything about this, as I am not a prophet;
but it seems to me an illogical piece of reasoning
to say: “These men rebelled when I treated them
ill, therefore they will rebel when I treat them
well.”</p>

<p>I would venture to take the liberty to invite those
who are at the head of the government, and those
who are destined for high positions, to reflect carefully
whether one really has ground to fear that
kindness will lead to the same revolts as cruelty;
whether what happened in certain circumstances is
sure to happen in different circumstances; if the
times, public opinion, and morals are unchanged.</p>

<p>The Huguenots, it is true, have been as inebriated
with fanaticism and stained with blood as we. But
are this generation as barbaric as their fathers?
Have not time, the progress of reason, good books,
and the humanising influence of society had an
effect on the leaders of these people? And do we
not perceive that the aspect of nearly the whole of
Europe has been changed within the last fifty years?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span></p>

<p>Government is stronger everywhere, and morals
have improved. The ordinary police, supported by
numerous standing armies, gives us some security
against a return to that age of anarchy in
which Calvinistic peasants fought Catholic peasants,
hastily enrolled between the sowing and the
harvest.</p>

<p>Different times have different needs. It would
be absurd to decimate the Sorbonne to-day because
it once presented a demand for the burning of the
Maid of Orleans, declared that Henry III. had forfeited
his kingdom, excommunicated him, and proscribed
the great Henry IV. We will not think of
inquiring into the other bodies in the kingdom who
committed the same excesses in those frenzied days.
It would not only be unjust, but would be as stupid
as to purge all the inhabitants of Marseilles because
they had the plague in 1720.</p>

<p>Shall we go and sack Rome, as the troops of
Charles V. did, because Sixtus V. in 1585 granted
an indulgence of nine years to all Frenchmen who
would take up arms against their sovereign? Is it
not enough to prevent Rome for ever from reverting
to such excesses?</p>

<p>The rage that is inspired by the dogmatic spirit
and the abuse of the Christian religion, wrongly
conceived, has shed as much blood and led to as
many disasters in Germany, England, and even Holland,
as in France. Yet religious difference causes
no trouble to-day in those States. The Jew, the
Catholic, the Greek, the Lutheran, the Calvinist, the
Anabaptist, the Socinian, the Memnonist, the Moravian,
and so many others, live like brothers in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
countries, and contribute alike to the good of the
social body.</p>

<p>They fear no longer in Holland that disputes
about predestination will end in heads being cut off.
They fear no longer at London that the quarrels
of Presbyterians and Episcopalians about liturgies
and surplices will lead to the death of a king on
the scaffold. A populous and wealthier Ireland
will no longer see its Catholic citizens sacrifice its
Protestant citizens to God during two months, bury
them alive, hang their mothers to gibbets, tie the
girls to the necks of their mothers, and see them
expire together; or put swords in the hands of their
prisoners and guide their hands to the bosoms of
their wives, their fathers, their mothers, and their
daughters, thinking to make parricides of them, and
damn them as well as exterminate them.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Such is
the account given by Rapin Thoyras, an officer in
Ireland, and almost a contemporary; so we find
in all the annals and histories of England. It will
never be repeated. Philosophy, the sister of religion,
has disarmed the hands that superstition
had so long stained with blood; and the human
mind, awakening from its intoxication, is amazed
at the excesses into which fanaticism had led it.</p>

<p>We have in France a rich province in which the
Lutherans outnumber the Catholics. The University
of Alsace is in the hands of the Lutherans.
They occupy some of the municipal offices; yet not
the least religious quarrel has disturbed this province
since it came into the possession of our kings.
Why? Because no one has ever been persecuted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
it. Seek not to vex the hearts of men, and they
are yours.</p>

<p>I do not say that all who are not of the same
religion as the prince should share the positions
and honours of those who follow the dominant religion.
In England the Catholics, who are regarded
as attached to the party of the Pretender, are not
admitted to office. They even pay double taxes.
In other respects, however, they have all the rights
of citizens.</p>

<p>Some of the French bishops have been suspected
of holding that it redounds neither to their honour
nor their profit to have Calvinists in their dioceses.
This is said to be one of the greatest obstacles to
toleration. I cannot believe it. The episcopal body
in France is composed of gentlemen, who think and
act with the nobility that befits their birth. They
are charitable and generous; so much justice must
be done them. They must think that their fugitive
subjects will assuredly not be converted in foreign
countries, and that, when they return to their
pastors, they may be enlightened by their instructions
and touched by their example. There would
be honour in converting them, and their material
interests would not suffer. The more citizens there
were, the larger would be the income from the
prelate’s estates.</p>

<p>A Polish bishop had an Anabaptist for farmer
and a Socinian for steward. It was suggested that
he ought to discharge and prosecute the latter because
he did not believe in consubstantiality, and
the former because he did not baptise his child until
it was fifteen years old. He replied that they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
be damned for ever in the next world, but that they
were very useful to him in this.</p>

<p>Let us get out of our grooves and study the rest
of the globe. The Sultan governs in peace twenty
million people of different religions; two hundred
thousand Greeks live in security at Constantinople;
the <em>muphti</em> himself nominates and presents to the
emperor the Greek patriarch, and they also admit
a Latin patriarch. The Sultan nominates Latin
bishops for some of the Greek islands, using the
following formula: “I command him to go and
reside as bishop in the island of Chios, according
to their ancient usage and their vain ceremonies.”
The empire is full of Jacobites, Nestorians, and
Monothelites; it contains Copts, Christians of St.
John, Jews, and Hindoos. The annals of Turkey
do not record any revolt instigated by any of these
religions.</p>

<p>Go to India, Persia, or Tartary, and you will find
the same toleration and tranquillity. Peter the
Great patronised all the cults in his vast empire.
Commerce and agriculture profited by it, and the
body politic never suffered from it.</p>

<p>The government of China has not, during the four
thousand years of its known history, had any cult
but the simple worship of one God. Nevertheless,
it tolerates the superstitions of Fo, and permits a
large number of bronzes, who would be dangerous
if the prudence of the courts did not restrain them.</p>

<p>It is true that the great Emperor Yang-Chin, perhaps
the wisest and most magnanimous emperor that
China ever had, expelled the Jesuits. But it was
not because he was intolerant; it was because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Jesuits were. They themselves give, in their curious
letters, the words of the good prince to them:
“I know that your religion is intolerant; I know
what you have done in Manila and Japan. You
deceived my father; think not to deceive me.” If
you read the whole of his speech to them, you will
see that he was one of the wisest and most clement
of men. How could he retain European physicians
who, under pretence of showing thermometers and
æolipiles at court, had carried off a prince of the
blood? What would he have said if he had read
our history and was acquainted with the days of
our League and of the Gunpowder Plot?</p>

<p>It was enough for him to be informed of the
indecent quarrels of the Jesuits, Dominicans, Franciscans,
and secular priests sent into his State from
the ends of the earth. They came to preach the
truth, and fell to anathematising each other. Hence
the emperor was bound to expel the foreign disturbers.
But how kindly he dismissed them! What
paternal care did he not devote to their journey,
and in order to protect them from insult on the
way? Their very banishment was a lesson in
toleration and humanity.</p>

<p>The Japanese were the most tolerant of all men.
A dozen peaceful religions throve in their empire,
when the Jesuits came with a thirteenth. As they
soon showed that they would tolerate no other, there
arose a civil war, even more frightful than that of
the League, and the land was desolated. In the
end the Christian religion was drowned in blood;
the Japanese closed their empire, and regarded us
only as wild beasts, like those which the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
have cleared out of their island. The minister Colbert,
knowing how we need the Japanese, who have
no need of us, tried in vain to reopen commerce
with their empire. He found them inflexible.</p>

<p>Thus the whole of our continent shows us that
we must neither preach nor practise intolerance.</p>

<p>Turn your eyes to the other hemisphere. Study
Carolina, of which the wise Locke was the legislator.
Seven fathers of families sufficed to set up
a public cult approved by the law; and this liberty
gave rise to no disorder. Heaven preserve us from
quoting this as an example for France to follow!
We quote it only to show that the greatest excess
of toleration was not followed by the slightest dissension.
But what is good and useful in a young
colony is not suitable for a long-established kingdom.</p>

<p>What shall we say of the primitive people who
have been derisively called Quakers, but who, however
ridiculous their customs may be, have been so
virtuous and given so useful a lesson of peace to
other men? There are a hundred thousand of them
in Pennsylvania. Discord and controversy are unknown
in the happy country they have made for
themselves; and the very name of their chief town,
Philadelphia, which unceasingly reminds them that
all men are brothers, is an example and a shame
to nations that are yet ignorant of toleration.</p>

<p>Toleration, in fine, never led to civil war; intolerance
has covered the earth with carnage. Choose,
then, between these rivals&mdash;between the mother who
would have her son slain and the mother who yields,
provided his life be spared.</p>

<p>I speak here only of the interest of nations. While<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
respecting theology, as I do, I regard in this article
only the physical and moral well-being of society.
I beg every impartial reader to weigh these truths,
verify them, and add to them. Attentive readers,
who restrain not their thoughts, always go farther
than the author.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">HOW TOLERATION MAY BE ADMITTED</h3>

<p>I venture to think that some enlightened and
magnanimous minister, some humane and wise prelate,
some prince who puts his interest in the number
of his subjects and his glory in their welfare,
may deign to glance at this inartistic and defective
paper. He will supply its defects and say to himself:
What do I risk in seeing my land cultivated
and enriched by a larger number of industrious
workers, the revenue increased, the State more
flourishing?</p>

<p>Germany would be a desert strewn with the bones
of Catholics, Protestants, and Anabaptists, slain by
each other, if the peace of Westphalia had not at
length brought freedom of conscience.</p>

<p>We have Jews at Bordeaux and Metz and in
Alsace; we have Lutherans, Molinists, and Jansenists;
can we not suffer and control Calvinists on
much the same terms as those on which Catholics
are tolerated at London? The more sects there are,
the less danger in each. Multiplicity enfeebles
them. They are all restrained by just laws which
forbid disorderly meetings, insults, and sedition,
and are ever enforced by the community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>We know that many fathers of families, who have
made large fortunes in foreign lands, are ready to
return to their country. They ask only the protection
of natural law, the validity of their marriages,
security as to the condition of their children,
the right to inherit from their fathers, and the
enfranchisement of their persons. They ask not
for public chapels, or the right to municipal offices
and dignities. Catholics have not these things in
England and other countries. It is not a question
of giving immense privileges and secure positions
to a faction, but of allowing a peaceful people to
live, and of moderating the laws once, but no longer,
necessary. It is not our place to tell the ministry
what is to be done; we do but ask consideration
for the unfortunate.</p>

<p>How many ways there are of making them useful,
and preventing them from ever being dangerous!
The prudence of the ministry and the Council, supported
as it is by force, will easily discover these
means, which are already happily employed by
other nations.</p>

<p>There are still fanatics among the Calvinistic
populace; but it is certain that there are far more
among the convulsionary [bigoted Catholic] populace.
The dregs of the fanatical worshippers of St.
Médard count as nothing in the nation; the dregs
of the Calvinistic prophets are annihilated. The
great means to reduce the number of fanatics, if
any remain, is to submit that disease of the mind
to the treatment of reason, which slowly, but infallibly,
enlightens men. Reason is gentle and
humane. It inspires liberality, suppresses discord,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and strengthens virtue; it has more power to make
obedience to the laws attractive than force has to
compel it. And shall we take no account of the
ridicule that attaches to-day to the enthusiasm of
these good people? Ridicule is a strong barrier
to the extravagance of all sectarians. The past is
as if it had never been. We must always start
from the present&mdash;from the point which nations
have already reached.</p>

<p>There was a time when it was thought necessary
to issue decrees against those who taught a doctrine
at variance with the categories of Aristotle,
the abhorrence of a vacuum, the quiddities, the universal
apart from the object. We have in Europe
more than a hundred volumes of jurisprudence on
sorcery and the way to distinguish between false
and real sorcerers. The excommunication of grasshoppers
and harmful insects has been much practised,
and still survives in certain rituals. But the
practice is over; Aristotle and the sorcerers and
grasshoppers are left in peace. There are countless
instances of this folly, once thought so important.
Other follies arise from time to time; but they
have their day and are abandoned. What would
happen to-day if a man were minded to call himself
a Carpocratian, a Eutychian, a Monothelite, a Monophysist,
a Nestorian, or a Manichæan? We should
laugh at him, as at a man dressed in the garb
of former days.</p>

<p>The nation was beginning to open its eyes when
the Jesuits Le Tellier and Doucin fabricated the
bull <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unigenitus</i> and sent it to Rome. They thought
that they still lived in those ignorant times when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the most absurd statements were accepted without
inquiry. They ventured even to condemn the proposition,
a truth of all times and all places: “The
fear of unjust excommunication should not prevent
one from doing one’s duty.” It was a proscription
of reason, of the liberties of the Gallican Church,
and of the fundamental principle of morals. It was
to say to men: God commands you never to do your
duty if you fear injustice. Never was common-sense
more outrageously challenged! The counsellors
of Rome were not on their guard. The papal
court was persuaded that the bull was necessary,
and that the nation desired it; it was signed,
sealed, and dispatched. You know the results;
assuredly, if they had been foreseen, the bull would
have been modified. There were angry quarrels,
which the prudence and goodness of the king have
settled.</p>

<p>So it is in regard to a number of the points which
divide the Protestants and ourselves. Some are of
no consequence; some are more serious; but on these
points the fury of the controversy has so far abated
that the Protestants themselves no longer enter into
disputes in their churches.</p>

<p>It is a time of disgust, of satiety, or, rather, of
reason, that may be used as an epoch and guarantee
of public tranquillity. Controversy is an epidemic
disease that nears its end, and what is now needed
is gentle treatment. It is to the interest of the
State that its expatriated children should return
modestly to the homes of their fathers. Humanity
demands it, reason counsels it, and politics need
not fear it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">WHETHER INTOLERANCE IS OF NATURAL AND<br />
HUMAN LAW</h3>

<p>Natural law is that indicated to men by nature.
You have reared a child; he owes you respect as
a father, gratitude as a benefactor. You have a
right to the products of the soil that you have cultivated
with your own hands. You have given or
received a promise; it must be kept.</p>

<p>Human law must in every case be based on natural
law. All over the earth the great principle
of both is: Do not unto others what you would
that they do not unto you. Now, in virtue of this
principle, one man cannot say to another: “Believe
what I believe, and what thou canst not believe,
or thou shalt perish.” Thus do men speak in
Portugal, Spain, and Goa. In some other countries
they are now content to say: “Believe, or I detest
thee; believe, or I will do thee all the harm I can.
Monster, thou sharest not my religion, and therefore
hast no religion; thou shalt be a thing of horror to
thy neighbours, thy city, and thy province.”</p>

<p>If it were a point of human law to behave thus,
the Japanese should detest the Chinese, who should
abhor the Siamese; the Siamese, in turn, should
persecute the Thibetans, who should fall upon the
Hindoos. A Mogul should tear out the heart of
the first Malabarian he met; the Malabarian should
slay the Persian, who might massacre the Turk;
and all of them should fling themselves against the
Christians, who have so long devoured each other.</p>

<p>The supposed right of intolerance is absurd and
barbaric. It is the right of the tiger; nay, it is far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
worse, for tigers do but tear in order to have food,
while we rend each other for paragraphs.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">WHETHER INTOLERANCE WAS KNOWN TO THE GREEKS</h3>

<p>The peoples of whom history has given us some
slight knowledge regarded their different religions
as links that bound them together; it was an association
of the human race. There was a kind of
right to hospitality among the gods, just as there
was among men. When a stranger reached a town,
his first act was to worship the gods of the country;
even the gods of enemies were strictly venerated.
The Trojans offered prayers to the gods who fought
for the Greeks.</p>

<p>Alexander, in the deserts of Libya, went to consult
the god Ammon, whom the Greeks called Zeus
and the Latins Jupiter, though they both had their
own Zeus or Jupiter at home. When a town was
besieged, sacrifices and prayers were offered to the
gods of the town to secure their favour. Thus in
the very midst of war religion united men and
moderated their fury, though at times it enjoined
on them inhuman and horrible deeds.</p>

<p>I may be wrong, but it seems to me that not one
of the ancient civilised nations restricted the freedom
of thought.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Each of them had a religion, but
it seems to me that they used it in regard to men
as they did in regard to their gods. All of them
recognised a supreme God, but they associated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
him a prodigious number of lesser divinities. They
had only one cult, but they permitted numbers of
special systems.</p>

<p>The Greeks, for instance, however religious they
were, allowed the Epicureans to deny providence and
the existence of the soul. I need not speak of the
other sects which all offended against the sound
idea of the creative being, yet were all tolerated.</p>

<p>Socrates, who approached nearest to a knowledge
of the Creator, is said to have paid for it, and
died a martyr to the Deity; he is the only man
whom the Greeks put to death for his opinions. If
that was really the cause of his condemnation, however,
it is not to the credit of intolerance, since
they punished only the man who alone gave glory
to God, and honoured those who held unworthy
views of the Deity. The enemies of toleration
would, I think, be ill advised to quote the odious
example of the judges of Socrates.</p>

<p>It is evident, moreover, that he was the victim
of a furious party, angered against him. He had
made irreconcilable enemies of the sophists, orators,
and poets who taught in the schools, and of all the
teachers in charge of the children of distinguished
men. He himself admits, in his discourse given to
us by Plato, that he went from house to house proving
to the teachers that they were ignorant. Such
conduct was hardly worthy of one whom an oracle
had declared to be the wisest of men. A priest and
a councillor of the Five Hundred were put forward
to accuse him. I must confess that I do not know
what the precise accusation was; I find only vagueness
in his apology. He is made to say, in general,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
that he was accused of instilling into young
men sentiments in opposition to the religion and
government. It is the usual method of calumniators,
but a court would demand accredited facts
and precise charges. Of these there is no trace in
the trial of Socrates. We know only that at first
there were two hundred and twenty votes in his
favour. From this we may infer that the court of
the Five Hundred included two hundred and twenty
philosophers; I doubt if so many could be found
elsewhere. The majority at length condemned him
to drink the hemlock; but let us remember that,
when the Athenians returned to their senses, they
regarded both the accusers and the judges with
horror; that Melitus, the chief author of the sentence,
was condemned to death for his injustice;
and that the others were banished, and a temple
was erected to Socrates. Never was philosophy so
much avenged and honoured. The case of Socrates
is really the most terrible argument that can be
used against intolerance. The Athenians had an
altar dedicated to foreign gods&mdash;the gods they knew
not. Could there be a stronger proof, not merely
of their indulgence to all nations, but even of respect
for their cults?</p>

<p>A French writer, in attempting to justify the
massacre of St. Bartholomew, quotes the war of the
Phocæans, known as “the sacred war,” as if this
war had been inspired by cult, or dogma, or theological
argument. Nay, it was a question only of
determining to whom a certain field belonged; it
is the subject of all wars. Beards of corn are not
a symbol of faith; no Greek town ever went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
war for opinions. What, indeed, would this gentleman
have? Would he have us enter upon a “sacred
war”?</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">WHETHER THE ROMANS WERE TOLERANT</h3>

<p>Among the ancient Romans you will not find, from
Romulus until the days when the Christians disputed
with the priests of the empire, a single man
persecuted on account of his opinions. Cicero
doubted everything; Lucretius denied everything;
yet they incurred not the least reproach. Indeed,
license went so far that Pliny, the naturalist, began
his book by saying that there is no god, or that,
if there is, it is the sun. Cicero, speaking of the
lower regions, says: “There is no old woman so
stupid as to believe in them (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non est anus tam
excors quæ credat</i>).” Juvenal says: “Even the
children do not believe (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nec pueri credunt</i>).” They
sang in the theatre at Rome: “There is nothing
after death, and death is nothing (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Post mortem
nihil est, ipsaque mors nihil</i>).” We may abhor
these maxims, or, at the most, forgive a people whom
the light of the gospel had not reached; but we
must conclude that the Romans were very tolerant,
since they did not excite a single murmur.</p>

<p>The great principle of the Senate and people of
Rome was, “Offences against the gods are the business
of the gods (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deorum offensa diis curæ</i>).” They
dreamed only of conquering, governing, and civilising
the world. They were our legislators and our
conquerors; and Cæsar, who gave us roads, laws,
and games, never attempted to compel us to abandon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
our druids for him, great pontiff as he was of
our sovereign nation.</p>

<p>The Romans did not profess all cults, or assign
public functions to all, but they permitted all. They
had no material object of worship under Numa, no
pictures or statues; though they presently erected
statues to “the gods of the great nations,” whom
they learned from the Greeks. The law of the Twelve
Tables, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deos peregrinos ne colunto</i> [“Foreign gods
shall not be worshipped”], means only that public
cult shall be given only to the superior divinities
approved by the Senate. Isis had a temple at Rome
until Tiberius destroyed it. The Jews were engaged
in commerce there since the time of the Punic war,
and had synagogues there in the days of Augustus.
They kept them almost always, as in modern Rome.
Can there be a clearer proof that toleration was
regarded by the Romans as the most sacred line of
the law of nations?</p>

<p>We are told that, as soon as the Christians appeared,
they were persecuted by the Romans, who
persecuted nobody. It seems to me that the statement
is entirely false, and I need only quote St.
Paul himself in disproof of it. In the <cite>Acts of the
Apostles</cite> (xxv. 16) we read that, when Paul was
dragged before the Roman Governor by the Jews
in some religious quarrel, Festus said: “It is not
the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to
die before that he which is accused have the accusers
face to face, and have license to answer for
himself.” These words are the more remarkable for
a Roman magistrate, because he seems to have had
nothing but contempt for Paul. Deceived by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
false light of his reason, he took Paul for a fool,
and said: “Much learning doth make thee mad.”
He was, therefore, having regard only to the equity
of Roman law in giving his protection to a stranger
for whom he had no esteem.</p>

<p>Thus the Holy Spirit, in inspiring <cite>Acts</cite>, testifies
that the Romans were just, and did not persecute.
It was not the Romans who fell upon Paul, but the
Jews. St. James, the brother of Jesus, was stoned
by the order of a Jewish Sadducee, not of a Roman.
The Jews alone stoned St. Stephen; and St. Paul,
in holding the cloaks of the executioners, certainly
did not act as a Roman citizen.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The first Christians had, no doubt, no cause of
quarrel with the Romans; their only enemies were
the Jews, from whom they were beginning to separate.
We know the fierce hatred that sectarians
always have for those who leave the sect. There
were probably disturbances in the synagogues at
Rome. Suetonius says, in his life of Claudius:
“Judæos impulsore Christo assidue tumultuantes
Roma expulit.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He was wrong in saying that
they were instigated by Christ, and was not likely
to be well informed in detail about a people so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
much despised at Rome as the Jews were; but he
was not mistaken as to the subject of the quarrels.
Suetonius wrote under Hadrian, in the second century,
when the Christians were not distinct from
the Jews in Roman eyes. His words show that the
Romans, instead of oppressing the first Christians,
rather coerced the Jews who persecuted them. They
wished the Roman synagogue to deal as indulgently
with their separated brethren as the Senate did.
The banished Jews returned soon afterwards, and
even attained high positions, in spite of the laws
which excluded them, as Dio Cassius and Ulpian
tell us. Is it possible that, after the ruin of Jerusalem,
the emperors should lavish honours on the
Jews, and persecute, and hand over to the executioner
or the beasts, Christians, who were regarded
as a Jewish sect?</p>

<p>It is said that Nero persecuted them. Tacitus
tells us that they were accused of setting fire to
Rome, and were abandoned to the fury of the people.
Was that on account of their religious belief?
Certainly not. Shall we say that the Chinese who
were slain by the Dutch a few years ago in the
suburbs of Batavia were sacrificed on account of
religion? However much a man may wish to deceive
himself, it is impossible to ascribe to intolerance
the disaster that befell a few half-Jewish, half-Christian
men and women at Rome under Nero.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">THE MARTYRS</h3>

<p>There were Christian martyrs in later years. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
is very difficult to discover the precise grounds on
which they were condemned; but I venture to think
that none of them were put to death on religious
grounds under the earlier emperors. All religions
were tolerated, and there is no reason to suppose
that the Romans would seek out and persecute certain
obscure men, with a peculiar cult, at a time
when they permitted all other religions.</p>

<p>Titus, Trajan, the Antonines, and Decius were
not barbarians. How can we suppose that they
deprived the Christians alone of a liberty which the
whole empire enjoyed? How could they venture to
charge the Christians with their secret mysteries
when the mysteries of Isis, Mithra, and the Syrian
goddess, all alien to the Roman cult, were freely
permitted? There must have been other reasons for
persecution. Possibly certain special animosities,
supported by reasons of State, led to the shedding
of Christian blood.</p>

<p>For instance, when St. Lawrence refused to give
to the Roman prefect, Cornelius Secularis, the
money of the Christians which he held, the prefect
and emperor would naturally be irritated. They
did not know that St. Lawrence had distributed the
money to the poor, and done a charitable and holy
act. They regarded him as rebellious, and had him
put to death.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>Consider the martyrdom of St. Polyeuctes. Was
he condemned on the ground of religion alone? He
enters the temple, in which thanks are being given
to the gods for the victory of the Emperor Decius.
He insults the sacrificing priests, and overturns
and breaks the altars and statues. In what country
in the world would such an outrage be overlooked?
The Christian who in public tore down
the edict of the Emperor Diocletian, and drew the
great persecution upon his brethren in the last two
years of the reign of that emperor, had more zeal
than discretion, and, unhappily, brought a great
disaster on the body to which he belonged. This
unthinking zeal, which often broke out, and was condemned
even by some of the fathers of the Church,
was probably the cause of all the persecutions.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, compare the early Protestants
with the early Christians; one cannot put error by
the side of truth. But it is a fact that Forel, the
predecessor of Calvin, did at Arles the same thing
that St. Polyeuctes had done in Armenia. The
statue of St. Antony the Hermit was being carried
in procession, and Forel and some of his companions
fell on the monks who carried it, beat and
scattered them, and threw St. Antony in the river.
He deserved the death which he managed to evade
by flight.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> If he had been content to call out to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
the monks that he did not believe that a crow
brought half a loaf to St. Antony the Hermit, or
that St. Antony conversed with centaurs and satyrs,
he would merely have merited a stern rebuke for
disturbing public order; and if, the evening after
the procession, he had calmly studied the story of
the crow, the centaurs, and the satyrs, they would
have had no reproach to make him.</p>

<p>You think that the Romans would have suffered
the infamous Antinous<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> to be raised to the rank
of the secondary gods, and would have rent and
given to the beasts those whose only reproach was
to have quietly worshipped one just God! You
imagine that they would have recognised a supreme
and sovereign God, master of all the secondary
gods, as we see in their formula, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus optimus
maximus</i>, yet persecuted those who worshipped one
sole God!</p>

<p>It is incredible that there was any inquisition
against the Christians&mdash;that men were sent among
them to interrogate them on their beliefs&mdash;under
the emperors. On that point they never troubled
either Jew, Syrian, Egyptian, Druid, or philosopher.
The martyrs were men who made an outcry against
what they called false gods. It was a very wise
and pious thing to refuse to believe in them; but,
after all, if, not content with worshipping God in
spirit and in truth, they broke out violently against
the established cult, however absurd it was, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
are compelled to admit that they were themselves
intolerant.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Tertullian admits in his <cite>Apology</cite> (ch. xxxix.)
that the Christians were regarded as seditious.
The charge was unjust, but it shows that it was
not merely their religion which stimulated the zeal
of the magistrates. He admits that the Christians
refused to decorate their doors with laurel branches
in the public rejoicings for the victories of the
emperors; such an affectation might easily be
turned into the crime of treason.</p>

<p>The first period of juridical severity against the
Christians was under Domitian, but it was generally
restricted to a banishment that did not last a year.
“Facile coeptum repressit, restitutis quos ipse relegaverat,”
says Tertullian [“He quickly repressed
the work, restoring those whom he had banished”].
Lactantius, whose style is so vehement, agrees that
the Church was peaceful and flourishing from Domitian
to Decius [96-250 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>].<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This long peace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
he says, was broken when “that execrable animal
Decius began to vex the Church.”</p>

<p>We need not discuss here the opinion of the
learned Dodwell that the martyrs were few in number;
but if the Romans persecuted the Christian
religion, if the Senate had put to death so many
innocent men with unusual tortures&mdash;plunging
Christians in boiling oil and exposing girls naked
to the beasts in the circus&mdash;how is it that they
left untouched all the earlier bishops of Rome?
St. Irenæus can count among them only one martyr,
Telesphorus, in the year 139 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; and we have no
proof that Telesphorus was put to death. Zepherinus
governed the flock at Rome for twenty-eight
years, and died peacefully in 219. It is true that
nearly all the popes are inscribed in the early
martyrologies, but the word “martyr” was then
taken in its literal sense, as “witness,” not as one
put to death.</p>

<p>It is difficult to reconcile this persecuting fury
with the freedom which the Christians had to hold
the fifty-six Councils which ecclesiastical writers
count in the first three centuries.</p>

<p>There were persecutions; but if they were as
violent as we are told, it is probable that Tertullian,
who wrote so vigorously against the established
cult, would not have died in his bed. We know,
of course, that the emperors would not read his
<cite>Apology</cite>&mdash;an obscure work, composed in Africa,
would hardly reach those who were ruling the
world. But it must have been known to those who
were in touch with the proconsul of Africa, and
ought to have brought a good deal of ill-feeling on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
its author. He did not, however, suffer martyrdom.</p>

<p>Origen taught publicly at Alexandria, and was not
put to death. This same Origen, who spoke so freely
to both pagans and Christians&mdash;announcing Jesus
to the former and denying a God in three persons
to the latter&mdash;says expressly, in the third book
of his <cite>Contra Celsum</cite>, that “there have been few
martyrs, and those at long intervals”; although,
he says, “the Christians do all in their power to
make everybody embrace their religion, running
about the towns and villages.”</p>

<p>It is clear that a seditious complexion might be
put by the hostile priests on all this running about,
yet the missions were tolerated, in spite of the
constant and cowardly disorders of the Egyptian
people, who killed a Roman for slaying a cat, and
were always contemptible.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Who did more to bring upon him the priests and
the government than St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, a
pupil of Origen? Gregory saw, during the night,
an old man, sent by God, and a woman shining
with light; the woman was the Virgin, and the man
St. John the Evangelist. John dictated to him a
creed, which Gregory went out to preach. In going
to Neocæsarea he passed by a temple in which
oracles were given, and the rain compelled him to
spend the night in it, after making many signs of
the cross. The following day the sacrificing priest
was astonished to find that the demons who were
wont to answer him would do so no longer. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
he called, they said that they would come no more,
and could not live in the temple, because Gregory
had spent the night in it and made the sign of the
cross in it.</p>

<p>The priest had Gregory seized, and Gregory said:
“I can expel the demons from wherever I like, and
drive them into wherever I like.” “Send them back
into my temple, then,” said the priest. So Gregory
tore off a piece from a book he had in his hand and
wrote on it: “Gregory to Satan: I order thee to
return to this temple.” The message was placed
on the altar, and the demons obeyed, and gave the
oracles as before.</p>

<p>St. Gregory of Nyssa tells us these facts in his
<cite>Life of St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</cite>. The priests in
charge of the idols must have been incensed against
Gregory, and wished, in their blindness, to denounce
him to the magistrates. But their greatest enemy
never suffered persecution.</p>

<p>It is said that St. Cyprian was the first bishop
of Carthage to be condemned to death, in the year
258. During a very long period, therefore, no bishop
of Carthage suffered for his religion. History does
not tell us what charges were made against St.
Cyprian, what enemies he had, and why the proconsul
of Africa was angry with him. St. Cyprian
writes to Cornelius, bishop of Rome: “There was,
a short time ago, some popular disturbance at Carthage,
and the cry was twice raised that I ought
to be cast to the lions.” It is very probable that
the excitement of the passionate populace of Carthage
was the cause of the death of Cyprian; it is,
at all events, certain that the Emperor Gallus did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
not condemn him on the ground of religion from
distant Rome, since he left untouched Cornelius,
who lived under his eyes.</p>

<p>So many hidden causes are associated at times
with the apparent cause, so many unknown springs
may be at work in the persecution of a man, that
it is impossible, centuries afterwards, to discover
the hidden source of the misfortunes even of distinguished
men; it is still more difficult to explain
the persecution of an individual who must have been
known only to those of his own party.</p>

<p>Observe that St. Gregory Thaumaturgus and St.
Denis, bishop of Alexandria, who were not put to
death, lived at the same time as St. Cyprian. How
is it that they were left in peace, since they were,
at least, as well known as the bishop of Carthage?
And why was Cyprian put to death? Does it not
seem as if the latter fell a victim to personal and
powerful enemies, under the pretext of calumny or
reasons of State, which are so often associated with
religion, and that the former were fortunate enough
to escape the malice of men?</p>

<p>It is impossible that the mere charge of being
a Christian led to the death of St. Ignatius under
the clement and just Trajan, since the Christians
were allowed to accompany and console him during
his voyage to Rome. Seditions were common at
Antioch, always a turbulent city, where Ignatius
was secret bishop of the Christians. Possibly these
seditions were imputed to the Christians, and
brought the authorities upon them.</p>

<p>St. Simeon, for instance, was charged before
Sapor with being a Roman spy. The story of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
martyrdom tells that King Sapor ordered him to
worship the sun, but we know that the Persians
did not worship the sun; they regarded it as an
emblem of the good principle Ormuzd, the god whom
they recognised.</p>

<p>However tolerant we may be, we cannot help
being indignant with the rhetoricians who accuse
Diocletian of persecuting the Christians as soon as
he ascended the throne. Let us consult Eusebius
of Cæsarea, the favourite and panegyrist of Constantine,
the violent enemy of preceding emperors.
He says (<cite>Ecclesiastical History</cite>, Bk. VIII.): “The
emperors for a long time gave the Christians proof
of their goodwill. They entrusted provinces to
them; several Christians lived in the palace; they
even married Christians. Diocletian married Prisca,
whose daughter was the wife of Maximianus
Galerius.”</p>

<p>We may well suspect that the persecution set
afoot by Galerius, after a clement and benevolent
reign of twenty-nine years, was due to some intrigue
that is unknown to us.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The story of the massacre of the Theban Legion
on religious grounds is absurd. It is ridiculous to
say that the legion came from Asia by the great
St. Bernard Pass; it is impossible that it should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
be brought from Asia at all to quell a sedition in
Gaul&mdash;a year after the sedition broke out, moreover;
it is not less incredible that six thousand
infantry and seven hundred cavalry could be slain
in a pass in which two hundred men could hold at
bay a whole army. The account of this supposed
butchery begins with an evident imposture: “When
the earth groaned under the tyranny of Diocletian,
heaven was peopled with saints.” Now, this episode
is supposed to have taken place in 286, a time when
Diocletian favoured the Christians, and the empire
flourished.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Finally&mdash;a point which might dispense
us from discussion altogether&mdash;there never was a
Theban Legion. The Romans had too much pride
and common-sense to make up a legion of Egyptians,
who served only as slaves at Rome; one might as
well talk of a Jewish Legion. We have the names
of the thirty-two legions which represented the chief
strength of the Roman Empire, and there is no
Theban Legion among them. We must relegate the
fable to the same category as the acrostic verses of
the Sibyls, which foretold the miracles of Christ,
and so many other forgeries with which a false zeal
duped the credulous.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">OF THE DANGER OF FALSE LEGENDS, AND OF PERSECUTION</h3>

<p>Untruth has imposed on men too long; it is time
to pick out the few truths that we can trace amid
the clouds of legends which brood over Roman history
after Tacitus and Suetonius, and have almost
always enveloped the annals of other nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p>How can we believe, for instance, that the Romans,
whose laws exhibit to us a people of grave and
severe character, exposed to prostitution Christian
virgins and young women of rank? It is a gross
misunderstanding of the austere dignity of the
makers of our laws, who punished so rigorously the
frailties of their vestal virgins. The “Sincere
Acts” of Ruinart describe these indignities; but
are we to put the “Acts” of Ruinart on a level
with the <cite>Acts of the Apostles</cite>? These “Sincere
Acts” say, according to the Bollandists, that there
were in the town of Ancyra seven Christian virgins,
each about seventy years old; that the governor
Theodectes condemned them to be handed
over to the young men of the town; and that he
changed the sentence, as was proper, and compelled
them to assist, naked, in the mysteries of Diana&mdash;at
which none ever assisted without a veil. St.
Theodotus&mdash;who, to tell the truth, kept a public-house,
but was not less zealous on that account&mdash;prayed
ardently to God to take these holy maidens
out of life, lest they should succumb to temptation.
God heard him. The governor then had them thrown
into a lake, with stones round their necks, and they
at once appeared to Theodotus and begged him to
see that their bodies were not eaten by fishes.</p>

<p>The holy publican and his companions went during
the night to the shore of the lake, which was
guarded by soldiers. A heavenly torch went before
them, and when they came to the spot where the
guards were, a heavenly cavalier, armed from top
to toe, chased the guards, lance in hand. St. Theodotus
drew from the lake the bodies of the virgins.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
He was brought before the governor&mdash;and the celestial
cavalier did not prevent the soldiers from cutting
off his head. We repeat that we venerate the
real martyrs, but it is not easy to believe this story
of the Bollandists and Ruinart.</p>

<p>Shall we tell the story of the young St. Romanus?
He was cast into the flames, says Eusebius, and
certain Jews who were present insulted Jesus
Christ for allowing his followers to be burned,
whereas God had withdrawn Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego from the fiery furnace. Hardly had
the Jews spoken when Romanus emerged in triumph
from the flames. The emperor ordered that he
should be pardoned, saying to the judge that he
did not want to fall foul of God. Curious words
for Diocletian! The judge, in spite of the emperor’s
pardon, ordered the tongue of Romanus to
be cut out; and, although he had executioners, he
had this operation performed by a physician. The
young Romanus, who had stuttered from birth,
spoke volubly as soon as his tongue was cut out.
The physician, to show that the operation had been
properly performed, took a man who was passing
and cut off just as much of his tongue as he had
done in the case of Romanus, and the man died.
“Anatomy teaches us,” says the author, learnedly,
“that a man cannot live without a tongue.” If
Eusebius really wrote this nonsense, and the passage
is not an interpolation, it is difficult to take
his history seriously.</p>

<p>Then there is the martyrdom of St. Felicitas and
her seven children, sent to death, it is said, by the
wise and pius Antoninus. In this case it seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
probable that some writer with more zeal than
truthfulness has imitated the story of the Maccabees.
The narrative begins: “St. Felicitas was a
Roman, and lived in the reign of Antoninus.” From
these words it is clear that the author was not a
contemporary of St. Felicitas. He says that the
prætor sat to judge them in the Campus Martius.
The forgery is exposed by this statement. The
Campus Martius, which had once been used for the
elections, then served for reviews of the troops and
for military games. Again, it is said that after
the trial the emperor entrusted the execution of
the sentence to various judges; which is quite opposed
to all procedure at that time or in our own.</p>

<p>Then there is a St. Hippolytus, who is supposed
to have been dragged by horses, like Hippolytus the
son of Theseus. This punishment was quite unknown
to the Romans, and it is merely the similarity of
name that has led to the invention of the legend.</p>

<p>You will observe in these accounts of the martyrs,
which were composed entirely by the Christians
themselves, that crowds of Christians always go
freely to the prison of the condemned, follow him
to the scaffold, receive his blood, bury his body, and
work miracles with his relics. If it were the religion
alone that was persecuted, would not the
authorities have arrested these declared Christians
who assisted their condemned brethren, and who
were accused of performing magic with the martyred
bodies? Would they not have been treated
as we treated the Waldensians, the Albigenses, the
Hussites, and the various sects of Protestants? We
slew them and burned them in crowds, without distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
of age or sex. Is there, in any reliable
account of the ancient persecutions, any single feature
that approaches our massacre of St. Bartholomew
or the Irish massacres? Is there a
single one with any resemblance to the annual festival
that is still held at Toulouse&mdash;a cruel and
damnable festival, in which a whole people thanks
God and congratulates itself that it slew four thousand
of its fellow-citizens two hundred years ago?</p>

<p>I say it with a shudder, but it is true; it is we
Christians who have been the persecutors, the executioners,
the assassins. And who were our victims?
Our brothers. It is we who have destroyed a hundred
towns, the crucifix or Bible in our hands, and
have incessantly shed blood and lit flames from the
reign of Constantine to the fury of the cannibals of
the Cévènes.</p>

<p>We still occasionally send to the gibbet a few
poor folk of Poitou, Vivarais, Valence, or Montauban.
Since 1745 [a period of seven years] we have
hanged eight of those men who are known as
“preachers” or “ministers of the gospel,” whose
only crime was to have prayed God for the king
in their native dialect and given a drop of wine
and a morsel of leavened bread to a few silly
peasants. These things are not done at Paris, where
pleasure is the only thing of consequence, and people
are ignorant of what is done in the provinces
and abroad. These trials are over in an hour; they
are shorter than the trial of a deserter. If the king
were aware of them, he would put an end to them.</p>

<p>Catholic priests are not treated thus in any Protestant
country. There are more than a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Catholic priests in England and Ireland; they are
known, and were untouched during the late war.</p>

<p>Shall we always be the last to embrace the wholesome
ideas of other nations? They have amended
their ways; when shall we amend ours? It took
us sixty years to admit what Newton had demonstrated;
we are hardly beginning to save the lives
of our children by inoculation; and it is only recently
that we have begun to act on sound principles
of agriculture. When shall we begin to act
on sound principles of humanity? How can we
have the audacity to reproach the pagans with
making martyrs when we have been guilty of the
same cruelty in the same circumstances?</p>

<p>Suppose we grant that the Romans put to death
numbers of Christians on purely religious grounds.
In that case the Romans were very much to blame.
Why should we be similarly unjust? Would we become
persecutors at the very time when we reproach
them with persecuting?</p>

<p>If any man were so wanting in good faith, or so
fanatical, as to say to me: “Why do you come to
expose our blunders and faults? Why do you destroy
our false miracles and false legends? They
nourish the piety of many people; there are such
things as necessary errors; do not tear out of the
body an incurable ulcer if it would entail the destruction
of the body”; I should reply to this man:
All these false miracles by which you shake the
trust that should be given to real ones, all these
absurd legends which you add to the truths of the
gospels, extinguish religion in the hearts of men.
Too many people who long for instruction, and have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
not the time to instruct themselves, say: “The
heads of my religion have deceived me, therefore
there is no religion. It is better to cast oneself into
the arms of nature than into those of error; I
would rather depend on the law of nature than on
the inventions of men.” Some are so unfortunate
as to go even farther. They see that imposture put
a curb on them, and they will not have even the
curb of truth. They lean to atheism. They become
depraved, because others have been false
and cruel.</p>

<p>These, assuredly, are the consequences of all the
pious frauds and all the superstitions. The reasoning
of men is, as a rule, only half-reasoning. It is
a very poor argument to say: “Voraginé, the
author of the <cite>Golden Legend</cite>, and the Jesuit Ribadeneira,
compiler of the <cite>Flowers of the Saints</cite>, wrote
sheer nonsense; therefore there is no God. The
Catholics have murdered a certain number of Huguenots,
and the Huguenots have murdered a certain
number of Catholics; therefore there is no God.
Men have made use of confession, communion, and
all the other sacraments, to commit the most horrible
crimes: therefore there is no God.” I should conclude,
on the contrary: Therefore there is a God
who, after this transitory life, in which we have
known him so little, and committed so many crimes
in his name, will vouchsafe to console us for our
misfortunes. For, considering the wars of religion,
the forty papal schisms (nearly all of which were
bloody), the impostures which have nearly all been
pernicious, the irreconcilable hatreds lit by differences
of opinion, and all the evils that false zeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
has brought upon them, men have long suffered hell
in this world.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ABUSES OF INTOLERANCE</h3>

<p>Do I propose, then, that every citizen shall be
free to follow his own reason, and believe whatever
this enlightened or deluded reason shall dictate to
him? Certainly, provided he does not disturb the
public order. It does not depend on man to believe
or not to believe; but it depends on him to respect
the usages of his country. If you insist that it is
a crime to disbelieve in the dominant religion, you
condemn the first Christians, your fathers, and you
justify those whom you reproach with persecuting
them.</p>

<p>You say that there is a great difference; that all
other religions are the work of man, and the
Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Church alone is the
work of God. But, surely, the fact that our religion
is divine does not imply that it should rule
by hatred, fury, exile, the confiscation of goods, imprisonment,
torture, murder, and thanksgiving to
God for murder? The more divine the Christian
religion is, the less it is the place of man to command
it; if God is its author, he will maintain it
without your aid. You know well that intolerance
begets only hypocrites or rebels. Fearful alternative!
Would you, indeed, sustain by executioners
the religion of a God who fell into the hands of
executioners, and who preached only gentleness and
patience?</p>

<p>Reflect on the frightful consequences of the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
of intolerance. If it were allowed to despoil, cast
in prison, and put to death a citizen who, at a
certain degree of latitude, would not profess the
religion generally admitted at that degree, how
could we except the leaders of the State from those
penalties? Religion equally binds the monarch and
the beggar; hence more than fifty doctors or monks
have made the monstrous assertion that it was lawful
to depose or slay any sovereign who dissented
from the dominant religion, and the Parliaments
of our kingdom have repeatedly condemned these
abominable decisions of abominable theologians.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The blood of Henry the Great [IV.] was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
warm when the Parlement de Paris issued a decree
making the independence of the Crown a fundamental
law. Cardinal Duperron, who owed his
position to Henry the Great, arose in the States of
1614 against the decree of the Parlement, and had
it suppressed. All the journals of the time record
the terms which Duperron used in his discourse:
“If a prince became an Arian,” he said, “we should
be obliged to depose him.”</p>

<p>Let us be allowed to say that every citizen is
entitled to inherit his father’s property, and that
we do not see why he should be deprived of it, and
dragged to the gibbet, because he takes sides with
one theologian against another.</p>

<p>We know that our dogmas were not always clearly
explained and universally received in the Church.
Christ not having said in what manner the Holy
Ghost proceeded, the Latin Church long believed
with the Greek that he proceeded from the Father
only; after a time it added, in the Creed, that he
also proceeded from the Son. I ask whether, the
day after this decision, any citizen who preferred
to keep to the old formula deserved to be put to
death? But is it less unjust and cruel to punish
to-day the man who thinks as people thought in
former times? Were men guilty in the days of
Honorius I. because they did not believe that Jesus
had two wills?</p>

<p>It is not long since the Immaculate Conception
began to be generally accepted; the Dominicans still
refuse to believe it.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> At what particular date will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
these Dominicans incur the penalties of heresy in
this world and the next?</p>

<p>If we need a lesson how to behave in these interminable
disputes, we should look to the apostles
and evangelists. There was ground for a violent
schism between Peter and Paul, and Paul withstood
Peter to the face, but the controversy was peacefully
settled. The evangelists in turn had a great field of
combat, if they had resembled modern writers. They
contradict each other frequently; yet we find no
dissension among their followers over these contradictions,
and they are neatly reconciled by the
fathers of the Church. St. Paul, in his epistle to
a few Jews at Rome who had been converted to
Christianity, says at the end of the third chapter
that faith alone glorifies, and works justify no one.
St. James, on the contrary, in his epistle (ch. ii.)
says constantly that one cannot be saved without
works. Here is a point that has separated two
great sects among us, yet made no division among
the apostles.</p>

<p>If the persecution of those with whom we dispute
were a holy action, the man who had killed most
heretics would be the greatest saint in Paradise.
What a poor figure the man who had been content
to despoil and imprison his brothers would cut by
the side of the zealot who had slain hundreds of
them on St. Bartholomew’s day! Here is a proof
of it. The successor of St. Peter and his consistory
cannot err. They approved, acclaimed, and consecrated
the massacre of St. Bartholomew. Therefore
this deed was holy; and therefore of two
assassins who were equal in piety one who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
killed twenty-four Huguenot women would have
double the glory of the man who had killed only
a dozen. By the same reasoning the fanatics of
Cévènes would have ground to believe that they
would be elevated in glory in proportion to the
number of priests, monks, and Catholic women they
had slain. It is a strange title to glory in heaven.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">WHETHER INTOLERANCE WAS OF DIVINE RIGHT IN JUDAISM,<br />
AND WHETHER IT WAS ALWAYS PRACTISED.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></h3>

<p>Divine right means, I believe, the precepts which
God himself has given. He ordered that the Jews
should eat a lamb cooked with lettuces, and that the
eaters should stand, with a stick in their hands,
in commemoration of the Passover; he commanded
that in the consecration of the high-priest blood
should be applied to his right ear, right hand, and
right foot. They seem curious customs to us, but
they were not to antiquity. He ordered them to
put the iniquities of the people on the goat <em>hazazel</em>,
and forbade them to eat scaleless fishes, hares, hedgehogs,
owls, griffins, etc. He instituted feasts and
ceremonies.</p>

<p>All these things, which seem arbitrary to other
nations, and a matter of positive law and usage,
being ordered by God himself, became a divine law
to the Jews, just as whatever Christ ordered is a
divine law for us. Let us not inquire why God
substituted a new law for that which he gave to
Moses, and why he laid more commandments on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Moses than on Abraham, and more on Abraham than
on Noah. It seems that he deigns to accommodate
himself to the times and the state of the human
race. It is a kind of paternal gradation. But these
abysses are too deep for our feeble sight. Let us
keep to our subject, and see first what intolerance
was among the Jews.</p>

<p>It is true that in <cite>Exodus</cite>, <cite>Numbers</cite>, <cite>Leviticus</cite>, and
<cite>Deuteronomy</cite> there are very severe laws, and even
more severe punishments, in connection with religion.
Many commentators find a difficulty in reconciling
the words of Moses with the words of
Jeremiah and Amos, and those of the celebrated
speech of St. Stephen in <cite>Acts</cite>. Amos says that in
the deserts the Jews worshipped Moloch, Rempham,
and Kium. Jeremiah says explicitly (vii., 12) that
God asked no sacrifice of their fathers when they
came out of Egypt. St. Stephen says in his speech
to the Jews (<cite>Acts</cite> vii., 42): “Then God turned
and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;
as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye
house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts
and sacrifices for the space of forty years in the
wilderness? Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of
Moloch, and the star of your god Rempham.”</p>

<p>Other critics infer that these gods were tolerated
by Moses, and they quote these words of <cite>Deuteronomy</cite>
(xii., 8): “When ye are in the land of
Canaan, ye shall not do all the things that we do
here this day, where every man does what he
pleases.” They find encouragement in the fact that
nothing is said of any religious act of the people
in the desert, and there is no mention of Passover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Pentecost, Feast of Tabernacles, or public prayer in
any shape. Circumcision, moreover, the seal of the
covenant, was not practised.</p>

<p>It is enough, it seems to me, that it is proved by
Holy Scripture that, in spite of the extraordinary
punishment inflicted on the Jews on account of the
cult of Apis, they had complete liberty for a long
time. Possibly the massacre of twenty-three thousand
men by Moses for worshipping the golden calf
set up by his brother led him to appreciate that
nothing was gained by severity, and induced him
to close his eyes to the people’s passion for strange
gods.</p>

<p>Sometimes he seems to transgress his own law.
He forbade the making of images, yet set up a
brazen serpent. We find another deviation from
the law in the temple of Solomon. He had twelve
oxen carved to sustain the great basin of the temple,
and in the ark were placed cherubim with the heads
of eagles and calves. It seems to have been this
calf-head, badly made, and found in the temple by
Roman soldiers, which led to the belief that the
Jews worshipped an ass.</p>

<p>The worship of foreign gods was vainly prohibited.
Solomon was quite at his ease in idolatry. Jeroboam,
to whom God had given ten parts of the
kingdom, set up two golden calves, and ruled for
twenty-two years, uniting in his person the dignities
of monarch and pontiff. The little kingdom
of Judah under Rehoboam raised altars and statues
to foreign gods. The holy king Asa did not destroy
the high places. The high-priest Urijah erects in
the temple, in the place of the altar of holocausts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
an altar to the king of Syria (2 <cite>Kings</cite>, xvi.). In
a word, there seems to be no real restraint in matters
of religion. I know that the majority of the
Jewish kings murdered each other, but that was
always to further a material interest, not on account
of belief.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>It is true that some of the prophets secured the
interest of heaven in their vengeance. Elias brought
down fire from heaven to consume the priests of
Baal. Elisha caused forty-two bears to devour the
children who commented on his baldness. But these
are rare miracles, and facts that it would be rather
hard to wish to imitate.</p>

<p>It is also objected that the Jewish people were
very ignorant and barbaric. In the war with the
Midianites Moses ordered that all the male children
and their mothers should be slain and the booty
divided. Some commentators even argue that
thirty-two girls were sacrificed to the Lord: “The
Lord’s tribute was thirty and two persons [virgins]”
(<cite>Numbers</cite> xxxii., 40). That the Jews did offer human
sacrifices is seen in the story of Jephthah
[<cite>Judges</cite> xi., 39], and the cutting-up of King Agag
by the priest Samuel. Ezekiel even promises that
they will eat human flesh: “Ye shall eat the horse
and the rider; ye shall drink the blood of princes.”
Some commentators apply two verses of this prophecy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
to the Jews themselves, and the others to the
carnivorous beasts. We do not find in the whole
history of this people any mark of generosity, magnanimity,
or beneficence; yet some ray of toleration
escapes always from the cloud of their long and
frightful barbarism.</p>

<p>The story of Micah and the Levite, told in chapters
xvii. and xviii. of <cite>Judges</cite>, is another incontestable
proof of the great liberty and toleration
that prevailed among the Jews. Micah’s wife, a
rich Ephraimite woman, had lost eleven hundred
pieces of silver. Her son restored them to her, and
she devoted them to the Lord, making images of
him, and built a small chapel. A Levite served the
chapel, receiving ten pieces of silver, a tunic, and
a cloak every year, besides his food; and Micah said:
“Now know I the Lord will do me good, seeing I
have a Levite to my priest” (xvii., 13).</p>

<p>However, six hundred men of the tribe of Dan,
who wanted to seize some village of the district to
settle in, and had no priest-Levite to secure the
favour of God for their enterprise, went to Micah’s
house, and took the ephod, idols, and Levite, in
spite of the remonstrances of the priest and the
cries of Micah and his mother. They then proceeded
with confidence to attack the village of Lais,
and put everything in it to fire and sword, as was
their custom. They gave the name of Dan to Lais
in honour of their victory, and set Micah’s idol on
an altar; and, what is still more remarkable, Jonathan,
grandson of Moses, was the high priest of this
temple, in which the God of Israel and Micah’s idol
were worshipped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<p>After the death of Gideon the Hebrews worshipped
Baal-berith for nearly twenty years, and gave up
the cult of Adonai; and no leader or judge or priest
cried for vengeance. Their crime was great, I admit;
but if such idolatry was tolerated, how much
the more easily should we tolerate differences within
the proper cult.</p>

<p>Some allege as a proof of intolerance that, when
the Lord himself had allowed his ark to be taken
by the Philistines in a battle, the only punishment
he inflicted on the Philistines was a secret disease,
resembling hemorrhoids, the overthrowing of the
statue of Dagon, and the sending of a number of
rats into their country. And when the Philistines,
to appease his anger, had sent back the ark, drawn
by two cows, which had calves, and offered to God
five golden rats and five golden anuses, the Lord
slew seventy elders of Israel and fifty thousand of
the people for looking at the ark. The answer is
plain, therefore: the Lord’s chastisement is not
connected with belief, or difference of cult, or
idolatry.</p>

<p>Had the Lord wished to punish idolatry, he would
have slain all the Philistines who dared to take his
ark, and who worshipped Dagon; but he slew instead
fifty thousand and seventy men of his own
people merely because they looked at an ark at
which they ought not to have looked. So different
are the laws, the morals, and the economy of the
Jews from anything that we know to-day; so far
are the inscrutable ways of God above our own!
However, God is not punishing a foreign cult, but
a profanation of his own, an indiscreet curiosity, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
act of disobedience, possibly a spirit of revolt. We
realise that such chastisements belong to God only
in the Jewish theocracy. We cannot repeat too
often that these times and ways have no relation
to our own.</p>

<p>Again, when in later years the idolatrous Naaman
asked Elisha if he were allowed to accompany his
king to the temple of Rimmon, and worship with
him, Elisha&mdash;the man who caused children to be
devoured by bears&mdash;merely said, “Go in peace.”
More remarkable still is the fact that the Lord
orders Jeremiah to put cords and yokes round his
neck, and send them to the kings of Moab, Ammon,
Edom, Tyre, and Sidon, saying, on the part of the
Lord: “I have given all your lands to Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, my servant.” Here we
have an idolatrous king declared to be the servant
and favourite of God.</p>

<p>The same Jeremiah, whom the petty king of the
Jews, Zedekiah, had put in prison and then pardoned,
advises the king, on the part of God, to surrender
to the king of Babylon. Thus God takes the
part of an idolatrous king. He gives him possession
of the ark, the mere sight of which had cost fifty
thousand and seventy Jews their lives, the holy of
holies, and the rest of the temple, the building of
which had cost a hundred and eight thousand gold
talents, a million and seventeen thousand silver
talents, and ten thousand gold drachmas, left by
David and his officers for the construction of the
house of the Lord; which, without counting the
funds used by Solomon, amounts to nineteen thousand
and sixty-two million francs, or thereabouts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
of our money [more than £750,000,000]. Never was
idolatry so signally rewarded! I am aware that
the figure is exaggerated, and may be due to a
copyist; but if you reduce the sum by half, or to
a fourth or an eighth, it is still astonishing. One
is hardly less surprised at the wealth which Herodotus
says he saw in the temple of Ephesus. But
treasures are nothing in the eyes of God; the title
of his “servant,” which is given to Nebuchadnezzar,
is the only real treasure.</p>

<p>God is equally favourable to Kir, or Koresh, or
Kosroes, whom we call Cyrus. He calls him “his
Christ,” “his Anointed,” although he was not
anointed in the ordinary meaning of the word, and
he followed the religion of Zoroaster; he calls him
his “shepherd,” though he was a usurper in the
eyes of men. There is no greater mark of predilection
in the whole of Scripture.</p>

<p>You read in <cite>Malachi</cite> that “from the east to the
west the name of God is great among the nations,
and pure oblations are everywhere offered to him.”
God takes as much care of the idolatrous Ninevites
as of the Jews; he threatens and pardons them.
Melchizedech, who was not a Jew, sacrificed to God.
The idolatrous Balaam was a prophet. Scripture
shows, therefore, that God not only tolerated other
peoples, but took a paternal care of them. And we
dare to be intolerant!</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">EXTREME TOLERANCE OF THE JEWS</h3>

<p>Hence both under Moses, the judges, and the
kings you find constant instances of toleration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Moses says several times (<cite>Exodus</cite> xx.) that “God
punishes the fathers in the children, down to the
fourth generation”; and it was necessary thus to
threaten a people to whom God had not revealed the
immortality of the soul, or the punishments and
rewards of another life. These truths were not
made known either in the Decalogue or any part
of <cite>Leviticus</cite> or <cite>Deuteronomy</cite>. They were dogmas
of the Persians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and
Cretans; but they by no means formed part of the
Jewish religion. Moses does not say: “Honour
thy father and thy mother if thou wouldst go to
heaven”; but: “Honour thy father and thy mother,
that thou mayst live long on the earth.” He threatens
the Jews only with bodily maladies and other
material evils. Nowhere does he tell them that
their immortal souls will be tortured after death
or be rewarded. God, who himself led his people,
punished or rewarded them at once for their good
or bad actions. Everything was temporal. Those
who ignorantly maintain that Moses taught the immortality
of the soul strip the New Testament of
one of its greatest advantages over the Old Testament.
It is certain that the law of Moses spoke
only of temporal chastisement, down to the fourth
generation. However, in spite of the precise formulation
of this law and the express declaration of
God that he would punish down to the fourth generation,
Ezekiel announces the very opposite to the
Jews. He says (xviii., 20) that the son will not
bear the iniquity of his father; and he even goes
so far as to make God say that he had given them
“statutes that were not good” (xx., 25).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>The book of <cite>Ezekiel</cite> was nevertheless inserted in
the canon of inspired writers. It is true that the
synagogue did not allow any one to read it until
he was thirty years old, as St. Jerome tells us; but
that was in order that young men might not make
evil use of the too candid pictures of vice in chapters
xvi. and xxiii. The book was always received, in
spite of the fact that it expressly contradicted
Moses.</p>

<p>When the immortality of the soul was at length
admitted, which probably began about the time of
the Babylonian captivity, the Sadducees continued
to believe that there were no punishments and
rewards after death, and that the power of feeling
and thinking perished with us, like the power of
walking and digesting. They denied the existence
of angels. They differed from the other Jews
much more than Protestants differ from Catholics,
yet they remained in the communion of their
brethren. Some of their sect even became high-priests.</p>

<p>The Pharisees believed in fatalism and metempsychosis.
The Essenians thought that the souls
of the just went to the Fortunate Islands, and those
of the wicked into a kind of Tartarus. They offered
no sacrifices, and met in a special synagogue. Thus,
when we look closely into Judaism, we are astonished
to find the greatest toleration in the midst
of the most barbaric horrors. It is a contradiction,
we must admit; nearly all nations have been
ruled by contradictions. Happy the contradiction
that brings gentler ways into a people with bloody
laws.</p>

<h3 class="allsmcap">WHETHER INTOLERANCE WAS TAUGHT BY CHRIST</h3>

<p>Let us now see whether Jesus Christ set up
sanguinary laws, enjoined intolerance, ordered the
building of dungeons of the inquisition, or instituted
bodies of executioners.</p>

<p>There are, if I am not mistaken, few passages in
the gospels from which the persecuting spirit might
deduce that intolerance and constraint are lawful.
One is the parable in which the kingdom of heaven
is compared to a king who invites his friends to
the wedding-feast of his son (<cite>Matthew</cite> xxii.). The
king says to them, by means of his servants: “My
oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are
ready. Come unto the marriage.” Some go off to
their country houses, without taking any notice of
the invitation; others go about their business; others
assault and slay the king’s servants. The king
sends his army against the murderers, and destroys
their town. He then sends out on the high road
to bring in to the feast all who can be found. One
of these sits at table without a wedding dress, and
is put in irons and cast into outer darkness.</p>

<p>It is clear that, as this allegory concerns only
the kingdom of heaven, it certainly does not give a
man the right to strangle or put in jail a neighbour
who comes to sup with him not wearing a festive
garment. I do not remember reading anywhere in
history of a prince who had a courtier arrested on
that ground. It is hardly more probable that, if
an emperor sent his pages to tell the princes of his
empire that he had killed his fatlings and invited
them to supper, the princes would kill the pages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
The invitation to the feast means selection for
salvation; the murder of the king’s envoys represents
the persecution of those who preach wisdom
and virtue.</p>

<p>The other parable (<cite>Luke</cite> xiv.) tells of a man who
invites his friends to a grand supper. When he is
ready to sit at table, he sends his servant to inform
them. One pleads that he has bought an
estate, and must go to visit it; as one does not
usually go to see an estate during the night, the
excuse does not hold. Another says that he has
bought five pairs of oxen, and must try them; his
excuse is as weak as the preceding&mdash;one does not
try oxen during the night. A third replies that
he has just married; and that, assuredly, is a good
excuse. Then the holder of the banquet angrily
summons the blind and the lame to the feast, and,
seeing that there are still empty places, says to his
valet: “Go out into the highways and hedges, and
compel them to come in.”</p>

<p>It is true that this parable is not expressly said
to be a figure of the kingdom of heaven. There has,
unhappily, been too much abuse of these words,
“Compel them to come in”; but it is obvious that
a single valet could not forcibly compel all the
people he meets to come and sup with his master.
Moreover, compulsory guests of this sort would not
make the dinner very agreeable. According to the
weightiest commentators, “Compel them to come
in” merely means “Beg, entreat, and press them
to come in.” What, I ask you, have this entreaty
and supper to do with persecution?</p>

<p>If you want to take things literally, will you say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
that a man must be blind and lame, and compelled
by force, to be in the bosom of the Church? Jesus
says in the same parable: “When thou makest a
dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy
brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours.”
Has any one ever inferred from this that
we must not dine with our kinsmen and friends
when they have acquired a little money?</p>

<p>After the parable of the feast Christ says (<cite>Luke</cite>
xiv. 26): “If any man come to me, and hate not
his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and
brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also,
he cannot be my disciple.... For which of you,
intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first
and counteth the cost?” Is there anybody in the
world so unnatural as to conclude that one must
hate one’s father and mother? Is it not clear that
the meaning is: Do not hesitate between me and
your dearest affections?</p>

<p>The passage in <cite>Matthew</cite> (xviii., 17) is quoted:
“If he neglect to hear the Church, let him be
unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.” That
does not absolutely say that we must persecute
pagans and the farmers of the king’s taxes; they
are cursed, it is true, but they are not handed over
to the secular arm. Instead of the prerogatives of
citizenship being taken from these farmers of taxes,
they have received the greatest privileges. It is the
only profession that is condemned in Scripture, and
the one most in favour with governments. Why,
then, should we not be as indulgent to our erring
brethren as to the tax-gatherers?</p>

<p>The persecuting spirit further seeks a justification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of itself in the driving of the merchants from the
temple and the sending of a legion of demons from
the body of a possessed man into the bodies of two
thousand unclean animals. But who can fail to
see that these are instances of the justice which
God deigns to render to himself for the contravention
of his law? It was a lack of respect for the
house of the Lord to change its purview into a
merchant’s shop. It is no use saying that the
Sanhedrim and the priests permitted this only for
the sake of the sacrifices. The God to whom the
sacrifices were made might assuredly destroy this
profanation, though he was hidden in a human
form; he might also punish those who introduced
into the country such enormous herds of animals
forbidden by a law which he deigned to observe
himself. These cases have no relation whatever to
persecution on account of dogma. The spirit of intolerance
must be very poor in argument to appeal
to such foolish pretexts.</p>

<p>Nearly all the rest of the words and actions of
Christ breathe gentleness, patience, and indulgence.
He does not even break out against Judas, who
must betray him; he commands Peter never to use
the sword; he reproaches the children of Zebedee,
who, after the example of Elias, wanted to bring fire
from heaven on a town that refused them shelter.</p>

<p>In the end Christ succumbed to the wicked. If
one may venture to compare the sacred with the
profane&mdash;God with a man&mdash;his death, humanly
speaking, had some resemblance to the death of
Socrates. The Greek philosopher was a victim to
the hatred of the sophists, priests, and leaders of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the people; the legislator of the Christians was destroyed
by the Scribes, Pharisees, and priests. Socrates
might have escaped death, and would not;
Jesus Christ offered himself voluntarily. The Greek
philosopher not only pardoned his calumniators and
his wicked judges, but begged them to treat his
children in the same way if they should ever be
so fortunate as, like himself, to incur their hatred;
the legislator of the Christians, infinitely superior,
begged his father to forgive his enemies.</p>

<p>If it be objected that, while Socrates was calm,
Jesus Christ seemed to fear death, and suffered
such extreme anguish that he sweated blood&mdash;the
strongest and rarest symptom of fear&mdash;this was because
he deigned to stoop to all the weakness of the
human body that he had put on. His body trembled&mdash;his
soul was invincible. He taught us that true
strength and grandeur consist in supporting the evils
under which our nature succumbs. It is a splendid
act of courage to meet death while you fear it.</p>

<p>Socrates had treated the sophists as ignorant
men, and convinced them of bad faith; Jesus, using
his divine rights, treated the Scribes and Pharisees
as hypocrites, fools, blind and wicked men, serpents,
and vipers.</p>

<p>Need I now ask whether it is tolerance or intolerance
that is of divine right? If you wish to
follow Jesus Christ, be martyrs, not executioners.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">THE ONLY CASES IN WHICH INTOLERANCE IS HUMANLY<br />
LAWFUL</h3>

<p>For a government to have the right to punish the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
errors of men it is necessary that their errors must
take the form of crime; they do not take the form
of crime unless they disturbed society; they disturb
society when they engender fanaticism; hence men
must avoid fanaticism in order to deserve toleration.</p>

<p>If a few young Jesuits, knowing that the Church
has condemned the Jansenists, proceed to burn a
house of the Oratorian priests because the Oratorian
Quesnel was a Jansenist, it is clear that these
Jesuits ought to be punished.</p>

<p>Again, if the Jesuits have acted upon improper
maxims, and their institute is contrary to the laws
of the kingdom, their society must be dissolved, and
the Jesuits must be abolished and turned into citizens.
The evil done to them is imaginary&mdash;the good
is real. What hardship is there in wearing a short
coat instead of a long black robe, and being free
instead of being a slave?</p>

<p>If the Franciscan monks, carried away by a holy
zeal for the Virgin Mary, go and destroy a Dominican
convent, because the Dominicans believe that
Mary was born in original sin, it will be necessary
to treat the Franciscans in much the same way as
the Jesuits.</p>

<p>We may say the same of the Lutherans and Calvinists.
It is useless for them to say that they
follow the promptings of their consciences, that it
is better to obey God than men, or that they are
the true flock, and must exterminate the wolves.
In such cases they are wolves themselves.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable examples of fanaticism
is found in a small Danish sect, whose principle
was excellent. They desired to secure eternal salvation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
for their brethren; but the consequences of
the principle were peculiar. They knew that all
infants which die unbaptised are damned, and that
those which are so fortunate as to die immediately
after baptism enjoy eternal glory. They therefore
proceeded to kill all the newly-baptised boys and girls
that they could find. No doubt this was a way
of securing for them the highest conceivable happiness
and preserving them from the sin and misery
of this life. But these charitable folk forgot that
it is not lawful to do a little evil that a great good
may follow; that they had no right to the lives of
these children; that the majority of parents are
carnal enough to prefer to keep their children rather
than see them slain in order to enter paradise; and
that the magistrate has to punish homicide, even
when it is done with a good intention.</p>

<p>The Jews would seem to have a better right than
any to rob and kill us. Though there are a hundred
instances of toleration in the Old Testament,
there are also some instances and laws of severity.
God has at times commanded them to kill idolaters,
and reserve only the marriageable girls. Now they
regard us as idolaters, and, although we tolerate
them to-day, it is possible that, if they became
masters, they would suffer only our girls to live.</p>

<p>They would, at least, be absolutely compelled to
slay all the Turks, because the Turks occupy the
lands of the Hittites, Jebusites, Amorrhæans, Jersensæans,
Hevæans, Aracæans, Cinæans, Hamatæans,
and Samaritans. All these peoples were
anathematised, and their country, which was more
than seventy-five miles long, was given to the Jews<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in several consecutive covenants. They ought to
regain their possessions, which the Mohammedans
have usurped for the last thousand years.</p>

<p>If the Jews were now to reason in this way, it
is clear that the only reply we should make would
be to put them in the galleys.</p>

<p>These are almost the only cases in which intolerance
seems reasonable.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ACCOUNT OF A CONTROVERSIAL DISPUTE IN CHINA</h3>

<p>In the early years of the reign of the great Emperor
Kam-hi a mandarin of the city of Canton
heard from his house a great noise, which proceeded
from the next house. He inquired if anybody was
being killed, and was told that the almoner of the
Danish missionary society, a chaplain from Batavia,
and a Jesuit were disputing. He had them
brought to his house, put tea and sweets before
them, and asked why they quarrelled.</p>

<p>The Jesuit replied that it was very painful for
him, since he was always right, to have to do with
men who were always wrong; that he had at first
argued with the greatest restraint, but had at length
lost patience.</p>

<p>The mandarin, with the utmost discretion, reminded
them that politeness was needed in all discussion,
told them that in China men never became
angry, and asked the cause of the dispute.</p>

<p>The Jesuit answered: “My lord, I leave it to you
to decide. These two gentlemen refuse to submit
to the decrees of the Council of Trent.”</p>

<p>“I am astonished,” said the mandarin. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
turning to the refractory pair, he said: “Gentlemen,
you ought to respect the opinions of a large
gathering. I do not know what the Council of
Trent is, but a number of men are always better
informed than a single one. No one ought to imagine
that he is better than others, and has a monopoly
of reason. So our great Confucius teaches;
and, believe me, you will do well to submit to the
Council of Trent.”</p>

<p>The Dane then spoke. “My lord speaks with the
greatest wisdom,” he said; “we respect great councils,
as is proper, and therefore we are in entire
agreement with several that were held before the
Council of Trent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if that is the case,” said the mandarin, “I
beg your pardon. You may be right. So you and
this Dutchman are of the same opinion, against this
poor Jesuit.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said the Dutchman. “This fellow’s
opinions are almost as extravagant as those of the
Jesuit yonder, who has been so very amiable to
you. I can’t bear them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said the mandarin. “Are
you not all three Christians? Have you not all
three come to teach Christianity in our empire?
Ought you not, therefore, to hold the same dogmas?”</p>

<p>“It is this way, my lord,” said the Jesuit; “these
two are mortal enemies, and are both against me.
Hence it is clear that they are both wrong, and
I am right.”</p>

<p>“That is not quite clear,” said the mandarin;
“strictly speaking, all three of you may be wrong.
I should like to hear you all, one after the other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<p>The Jesuit then made a rather long speech, during
which the Dane and the Dutchman shrugged their
shoulders. The mandarin did not understand a
word of it. Then the Dane spoke; the two opponents
regarded each other with pity, and the mandarin
again failed to understand. The Dutchman had
the same effect. In the end they all spoke together
and abused each other roundly. The good mandarin
secured silence with great difficulty, and said: “If
you want us to tolerate your teaching here, begin by
being yourselves neither intolerant nor intolerable.”</p>

<p>When they went out the Jesuit met a Dominican
friar, and told him that he had won, adding that
truth always triumphed. The Dominican said:
“Had I been there, you would not have won; I
should have convicted you of lying and idolatry.”
The quarrel became warm, and the Jesuit and Dominican
took to pulling each other’s hair. The mandarin,
on hearing of the scandal, sent them both
to prison. A sub-mandarin said to the judge:
“How long does your excellency wish them to be
kept in prison?” “Until they agree,” said the judge.
“Then,” said the sub-mandarin, “they are in prison
for life.” “In that case,” said the judge, “until
they forgive each other.” “They will never forgive
each other,” said the other; “I know them.”
“Then,” said the mandarin, “let them stop there
until they pretend to forgive each other.”</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">WHETHER IT IS USEFUL TO MAINTAIN THE PEOPLE IN<br />
SUPERSTITION</h3>

<p>Such is the weakness, such the perversity, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
human race that it is better, no doubt, for it to
be subject to all conceivable superstitions, provided
they be not murderous, than to live without religion.
Man has always needed a curb; and, although
it was ridiculous to sacrifice to fauns or
naiads, it was much more reasonable and useful
to worship these fantastic images of the deity than
to sink into atheism. A violent atheist would be
as great a plague as a violent superstitious man.</p>

<p>When men have not sound ideas of the divinity,
false ideas will take their place; just as, in ages
of impoverishment, when there is not sound money,
people use bad coin. The pagan feared to commit
a crime lest he should be punished by his false
gods; the Asiatic fears the chastisement of his
pagoda. Religion is necessary wherever there is a
settled society. The laws take care of known
crimes; religion watches secret crime.</p>

<p>But once men have come to embrace a pure and
holy religion, superstition becomes, not merely useless,
but dangerous. We must not feed on acorns
those to whom God offers bread.</p>

<p>Superstition is to religion what astrology is to
astronomy&mdash;the mad daughter of a wise mother.
These daughters have too long dominated the earth.</p>

<p>When, in our ages of barbarism, there were
scarcely two feudal lords who had a New Testament
in their homes, it might be pardonable to
press fables on the vulgar; that is to say, on these
feudal lords, their weak-minded wives, and their
brutal vassals. They were led to believe that St.
Christopher had carried the infant Jesus across a
river; they were fed with stories of sorcery and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
diabolical possession; they readily believed that St.
Genou healed gout, and St. Claire sore eyes. The
children believed in the werewolf, and their parents
in the girdle of St. Francis. The number of relics
was incalculable.</p>

<p>The sediment of these superstitions remained
among the people even when religion had been purified.
We know that when M. de Noailles, Bishop
of Chalons, removed and threw in the fire the pretended
relic of the sacred navel of Jesus Christ the
town of Chalons took proceedings against him. But
his courage was equal to his piety, and he succeeded
in convincing the people that they could worship
Jesus Christ in spirit and truth without having his
navel in their church.</p>

<p>The Jansenists contributed not a little gradually
to root out from the mind of the nation the false
ideas that dishonoured the Christian religion. People
ceased to believe that it sufficed to pray for
thirty days to the Virgin to obtain all that they
wished, and sin with impunity.</p>

<p>In the end the citizens began to suspect that it
was not really St. Genevieve who gave or withheld
rain, but God himself who disposed of the elements.
The monks were astonished to see that their saints
no longer worked miracles. If the writers of the
life of St. Francis Xavier returned to this world,
they would not dare to say that the saint raised
nine people from the dead, that he was in two places
at the same time, and that, when his crucifix fell
into the sea, a crab restored it to him.</p>

<p>It is the same with excommunication. Historians
tell us that when King Robert had been excommunicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
by Pope Gregory V., for marrying his godmother,
the Princess Bertha, his servants threw out
of the window the meat served up to the king, and
Queen Bertha was delivered of a goose in punishment
of the incestuous marriage. I doubt if in our time
the waiters of the king of France would, if he were
excommunicated, throw his dinner out of the window,
and whether the queen would give birth to a
gosling.</p>

<p>There remain, it is true, a few bigoted fanatics in
the suburbs; but the disease, like vermin, attacks
only the lowest of the populace. Every day reason
penetrates farther into France, into the shops of
merchants as well as the mansions of lords. We
must cultivate the fruits of reason, the more willingly
since it is now impossible to prevent them from
developing. France, enlightened by Pascal, Nicole,
Arnaud, Bossuet, Descartes, Gassendi, Bayle, Fontenelle,
etc., cannot be ruled as it was ruled in
earlier times.</p>

<p>If the masters of error&mdash;the grand masters&mdash;so
long paid and honoured for brutalising the human
species, ordered us to-day to believe that the seed
must die in order to germinate; that the earth
stands motionless on its foundations&mdash;that it does
not travel round the sun; that the tides are not
a natural effect of gravitation; that the rainbow
is not due to the refraction and reflection of light,
etc., and based their decrees on ill-understood passages
of Scripture, we know how they would be regarded
by educated men. Would it be too much to
call them fools? And if these masters employed
force and persecution to secure the ascendancy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
their insolent ignorance, would it be improper to
speak of them as wild beasts?</p>

<p>The more the superstitions of the monks are
despised, the more the bishops and priests are respected;
while they do good, the monkish superstitions
from Rome do nothing but evil. And of all
these superstitions, is not the most dangerous that
of hating one’s neighbour on account of his opinions?
And is it not evident that it would be even
more reasonable to worship the sacred navel, the
sacred prepuce, and the milk and dress of the
Virgin Mary, than to detest and persecute one’s
brother?</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">VIRTUE BETTER THAN SCIENCE</h3>

<p>The less we have of dogma, the less dispute; the
less we have of dispute, the less misery. If that is
not true, I am wrong.</p>

<p>Religion was instituted to make us happy in this
world and the next. What must we do to be happy
in the next world? Be just.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> What must we do
to be happy in this world, as far as the misery of
our nature allows? Be indulgent.</p>

<p>It would be the height of folly to pretend to bring
all men to have the same thoughts in metaphysics.
It would be easier to subdue the whole universe by
arms than to subdue all the minds in a single city.</p>

<p>Euclid easily persuaded all men of the truths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
geometry. How? Because every single one of them
is a corollary of the axiom, “Two and two make
four.” It is not exactly the same in the mixture
of metaphysics and theology.</p>

<p>When Bishop Alexander and the priest Arius
began [in the fourth century] to dispute as to the
way in which the Logos emanated from the Father,
the Emperor Constantine at first wrote to them as
follows (as we find in Eusebius and Socrates):
“You are great fools to dispute about things you
do not understand.”</p>

<p>If the two parties had been wise enough to perceive
that the emperor was right, the Christian
world would not have been stained with blood for
three hundred years.</p>

<p>What, indeed, can be more stupid and more
horrible than to say to men: “My friends, it is
not enough to be loyal subjects, submissive children,
tender fathers, just neighbours, and to practise
every virtue, cultivate friendship, avoid ingratitude,
and worship Christ in peace; you must, in addition,
know how one is engendered from all eternity, and
how to distinguish the <em>homoousion</em> in the <em>hypostasis</em>,
or we shall condemn you to be burned for ever, and
will meantime put you to death”?</p>

<p>Had such a proposition been made to Archimedes,
or Poseidonius, or Varro, or Cato, or Cicero, what
would he have said?</p>

<p>Constantine did not persevere in his resolution
to impose silence on the contending parties. He
might have invited the leaders of the pious frenzy
to his palace and asked them what authority they
had to disturb the world: “Have you the title-deeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
of the divine family? What does it matter to you
whether the Logos was made or engendered, provided
men are loyal to him, preach a sound morality,
and practise it as far as they can? I have done
many wrong things in my time, and so have you.
You are ambitious, so am I. The empire has cost
me much knavery and cruelty; I have murdered
nearly all my relatives. I repent, and would expiate
my crimes by restoring peace to the Roman
Empire. Do not prevent me from doing the only
good that can efface my earlier barbarity. Help
me to end my days in peace.” Possibly he would
have had no influence on the disputants; possibly
he would have been flattered to find himself, in
long red robe, his head covered with jewels, presiding
at a council.</p>

<p>Yet this it was that opened the gate to all the
plagues that came from Asia upon the West. From
every disputed verse of Scripture there issued a
fury, armed with a sophism and a sword, that
goaded men to madness and cruelty. The marauding
Huns and Goths and Vandals did infinitely
less harm; and the greatest harm they did was to
join themselves in these fatal disputes.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">OF UNIVERSAL TOLERATION</h3>

<p>One does not need great art and skilful eloquence
to prove that Christians ought to tolerate each
other&mdash;nay, even to regard all men as brothers.
Why, you say, is the Turk, the Chinese, or the Jew
my brother? Assuredly; are we not all children
of the same father, creatures of the same God?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<p>But these people despise us and treat us as
idolaters. Very well; I will tell them that they
are quite wrong. It seems to me that I might
astonish, at least, the stubborn pride of a Mohammedan
or a Buddhist priest if I spoke to them
somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>This little globe, which is but a point, travels in
space like many other globes; we are lost in the
immensity. Man, about five feet high, is certainly
a small thing in the universe. One of these imperceptible
beings says to some of his neighbours, in
Arabia or South Africa: “Listen to me, for the
God of all these worlds has enlightened me. There
are nine hundred million little ants like us on the
earth, but my ant-hole alone is dear to God. All
the others are eternally reprobated by him. Mine
alone will be happy.”</p>

<p>They would then interrupt me, and ask who was
the fool that talked all this nonsense. I should be
obliged to tell them that it was themselves. I
would then try to appease them, which would be
difficult.</p>

<p>I would next address myself to the Christians,
and would venture to say to, for instance, a Dominican
friar&mdash;an inquisitor of the faith: “Brother,
you are aware that each province in Italy has its
own dialect, and that people do not speak at Venice
and Bergamo as they do at Florence. The Academy
of La Crusca has fixed the language. Its dictionary
is a rule that has to be followed, and the
grammar of Matei is an infallible guide. But do
you think that the consul of the Academy, or Matei
in his absence, could in conscience cut out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
tongues of all the Venetians and the Bergamese who
persisted in speaking their own dialect?”</p>

<p>The inquisitor replies: “The two cases are very
different. In our case it is a question of your eternal
salvation. It is for your good that the heads
of the inquisition direct that you shall be seized on
the information of any one person, however infamous
or criminal; that you shall have no advocate
to defend you; that the name of your accuser
shall not be made known to you; that the inquisitor
shall promise you pardon and then condemn you;
and that you shall then be subjected to five kinds
of torture, and afterwards either flogged or sent
to the galleys or ceremoniously burned. On this
Father Ivonet, Doctor Chucalon, Zanchinus, Campegius,
Royas, Telinus, Gomarus, Diabarus, and
Gemelinus are explicit, and this pious practice
admits of no exception.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>I would take the liberty of replying: “Brother,
possibly you are right. I am convinced that you
wish to do me good. But could I not be saved
without all that?”</p>

<p>It is true that these absurd horrors do not stain
the face of the earth every day; but they have often
done so, and the record of them would make up a
volume much larger than the gospels which condemn
them. Not only is it cruel to persecute, in
this brief life, those who differ from us, but I am
not sure if it is not too bold to declare that they
are damned eternally. It seems to me that it is
not the place of the atoms of a moment, such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
we are, thus to anticipate the decrees of the Creator.
Far be it from me to question the principle, “Out
of the Church there is no salvation.” I respect it,
and all that it teaches; but do we really know all
the ways of God, and the full range of his mercies?
May we not hope in him as much as fear him?
It is not enough to be loyal to the Church? Must
each individual usurp the rights of the Deity, and
decide, before he does, the eternal lot of all men?</p>

<p>When we wear mourning for a king of Sweden,
Denmark, England, or Prussia, do we say that we
wear mourning for one who burns eternally in hell?
There are in Europe forty million people who are
not of the Church of Rome. Shall we say to each
of them: “Sir, seeing that you are infallibly damned,
I will neither eat, nor deal, nor speak with you”?</p>

<p>What ambassador of France, presented in audience
to the Sultan, would say in the depths of his
heart: “His Highness will undoubtedly burn for
all eternity because he has been circumcised”? If
he really believed that the Sultan is the mortal
enemy of God, the object of his vengeance, could he
speak to him? Ought he to be sent to him? With
whom could we have intercourse? What duty of
civil life could we ever fulfil if we were really
convinced that we were dealing with damned souls?</p>

<p>Followers of a merciful God, if you were cruel of
heart; if, in worshipping him whose whole law consisted
in loving one’s neighbour as oneself, you had
burdened this pure and holy law with sophistry and
unintelligible disputes; if you had lit the fires of
discord for the sake of a new word or a single
letter of the alphabet; if you had attached eternal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
torment to the omission of a few words or ceremonies
that other peoples could not know, I should
say to you:</p>

<p>“Transport yourselves with me to the day on
which all men will be judged, when God will deal
with each according to his works. I see all the
dead of former ages and of our own stand in his
presence. Are you sure that our Creator and Father
will say to the wise and virtuous Confucius, to the
lawgiver Solon, to Pythagoras, to Zaleucus, to Socrates,
to Plato, to the divine Antonines, to the good
Trajan, to Titus, the delight of the human race, to
Epictetus, and to so many other model men: “Go,
monsters, go and submit to a chastisement infinite
in its intensity and duration; your torment shall
be as eternal as I. And you, my beloved, Jean
Chatel, Ravaillac, Damiens, Cartouche, etc. [assassins
in the cause of the Church], who have died
with the prescribed formulæ, come and share my
empire and felicity for ever.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>You shrink with horror from such sentiments;
and, now that they have escaped me, I have no more
to say to you.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ON_SUPERSTITION">ON SUPERSTITION</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Brethren</span>:</p>

<p>You are aware that all prominent nations have
set up a public cult. Men have at all times assembled
to deal with their interests and communicate
their needs, and it was quite natural that they
should open these meetings with some expression of
the respect and love which they owe to the author
of their lives. This homage has been compared to
the respect which children pay to their father, and
subjects to their sovereign. These are but feeble
images of the worship of God. The relations of
man to man have no proportion to the relation of
the creature to the Supreme Being; there is no
affinity between them. It would even be blasphemy
to render homage to God in the form of a monarch.
A ruler of the whole earth&mdash;if there could be such
a person, and all men were so unhappy as to be
subject to one man&mdash;would be but a worm of the
earth, commanding other worms of the earth; he
would still be infinitely lower than the Deity. In
republics, moreover, which are unquestionably
earlier than any monarchy, how could God be conceived
in the shape of a king? If it be necessary
to represent God in any sensible form, the idea of
a father, defective as it is, would seem to be the
best fitted to our weakness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<p>But emblems of the Deity were one of the first
sources of superstition. As soon as we made God
in our own image, the divine cult was perverted.
Having dared to represent God in the form of a
man, our wretched imagination, which never halts,
ascribed to him all the vices of a man. We regarded
him only as a powerful master, and we
charged him with abuse of power; we described him
as proud, jealous, angry, vindictive, maleficent,
capricious, pitilessly destructive, a despoiler of
some to enrich others, with no other reason but
his will. Our ideas are confined to the things about
us; we conceive hardly anything except by similitudes;
and so, when the earth was covered with
tyrants, God was regarded as the first of tyrants.
It was much worse when the Deity was presented
in emblems taken from animals and plants. God
became an ox, serpent, crocodile, ape, cat, or lamb;
bellowing, hissing, devouring, and being devoured.</p>

<p>The superstition of almost all nations has been
so horrible that, did not the monuments of it survive,
it would be impossible to believe the accounts
of it. The history of the world is the history of
fanaticism.</p>

<p>Have there been innocent superstitions among
the monstrous forms that have covered the earth?
Can we not distinguish between poisons which have
been used as remedies and poisons which have retained
their murderous nature? If I mistake not,
here is an inquiry worth the close attention of
reasonable men.</p>

<p>A man does good to his fellows and brothers.
One man destroys carnivorous beasts; another invents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
arts by the force of his genius. They are,
on that account, regarded as higher in the favour
of God than other men, as children of God; they
become demi-gods, or secondary gods, when they
die. They are proposed to other men, not merely
as models, but as objects of worship. He who worships
Hercules and Perseus is incited to imitate
them. Altars are the reward of genius and courage.
I see in that only an error which leads to good. In
that case they are deceived to their own advantage.
How could we reproach the ancient Romans if they
had raised to the rank of secondary gods only such
men as Scipio, Titus, Trajan, and Marcus Aurelius?</p>

<p>There is an infinite distance between God and
man. We agree; but if, in the system of the ancients,
the human soul was regarded as a finite
portion of the infinite intelligence, sinking back
into the great whole without adding to it; if it
be supposed that God dwelt in the soul of Marcus
Aurelius, since his soul was superior to others in
virtue during life; why may we not suppose that
it is still superior when it is separated from its
mortal body?</p>

<p>Our brothers of the Roman Catholic Church (for
all men are brothers) have filled heaven with demi-gods,
which they call “saints.” Had they always
chosen them wisely, we may candidly allow that
their error would have been of service to human
nature. We pour on them our disdain only because
they honour an Ignatius, the knight of the
Virgin, a Dominic, the persecutor, or a Francis,
fanatical to the pitch of madness, who goes naked,
speaks to animals, catechises a wolf, and makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
himself a wife of snow. We cannot forgive Jerome,
the learned but faulty translator of the Jewish
books, for having, in his history of the fathers of
the desert, demanded our respect for a St. Pacomius,
who paid his visits on the back of a crocodile.
We are especially angered when we see that Rome
has canonised Gregory VII., the incendiary of
Europe.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with the cult that is paid in
France to King Louis IX., who was just and
courageous. If it is too much to invoke him, it is
not too much to revere him. It is but to say to
other princes: Imitate his virtues.</p>

<p>I go farther. Suppose there had been placed in
some church the statue of Henry IV., who won his
kingdom with the valour of Alexander and the
clemency of Titus, who was good and compassionate,
chose the best ministers and was his own first
minister; suppose that, in spite of his weaknesses,
he received a homage beyond the respect which we
owe to great men. What harm would be done? It
would assuredly be better to bend the knee before
him than before this crowd of unknown saints,
whose very names have become a subject of opprobrium
and ridicule. I agree that it would be a
superstition, but a superstition that could do no
harm; a patriotic enthusiasm, not a pernicious
fanaticism. If man is born to error, let us wish
him virtuous errors.</p>

<p>The superstition that we must drive from the
earth is that which, making a tyrant of God, invites
men to become tyrants. He who was the first to
say that we must detest the wicked put a sword in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the hands of all who dared to think themselves
faithful. He who was the first to forbid communication
with those who were not of his opinion rang
the tocsin of civil war throughout the earth.</p>

<p>I believe what seems to reason impossible&mdash;in
other words, I believe what I do not believe&mdash;and
therefore I must hate those who boast that they
believe an absurdity opposed to mine. Such is the
logic&mdash;such, rather, is the madness&mdash;of the superstitious.
To worship, love, and serve the Supreme
Being, and to be of use to men, is nothing; it is
indeed, according to some, a false virtue, a “splendid
sin,” as they call it. Ever since men made it
a sacred duty to dispute about what they cannot
understand, and made virtue consist in the pronunciation
of certain unintelligible words, which
every one attempted to explain, Christian countries
have been a theatre of discord and carnage.</p>

<p>You will tell me that this universal pestilence
should be imputed to the fury of ambition rather
than to that of fanaticism. I answer that it is due
to both. The thirst for domination has been assuaged
with the blood of fools. I do not aspire to
heal men of power of this furious passion to subject
the minds of others; it is an incurable disease.
Every man would like to see others hastening to
serve him; and, that he may be the better served,
he will, if he can, make them believe that their duty
and their happiness are to be slaves. Find me a
man with an income of a hundred thousand pounds
a year, and with four or five hundred thousand
subjects throughout Europe, who cost him nothing,
besides his soldiers, and tell him that Christ, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
whom he is the vicar and imitator, lived in poverty
and humility. He will reply that the times are
changed, and to prove it he will condemn you to
perish in the flames. You will neither correct this
man [the Pope] nor a Cardinal de Lorraine, the
simultaneous possessor of seven bishoprics. What
can one do, then? Appeal to the people, and, brutalised
as they are, they listen and half open their
eyes. They partly throw off the most humiliating
yoke that has ever been borne. They rid themselves
of some of their errors, and win back a part
of their freedom, that appanage or essence of man
of which they had been robbed. We cannot cure
the powerful of ambition, but we can cure the people
of superstition. We can, by speech and pen,
make men more enlightened and better.</p>

<p>It is easy to make them see what they have suffered
during fifteen hundred years. Few people
read, but all may listen. Listen, then, my brethren,
and hear the calamities which have fallen on earlier
generations.</p>

<p>Hardly had the Christians, breathing freely under
Constantine, dipped their hands in the blood of the
virtuous Valeria,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> daughter, wife, and mother of
the Cæsars, and in the blood of her young son
Candidian, the hope of the Empire; hardly had they
put to death the son of the Emperor Maximin, in
his eighth year, and his daughter in her seventh
year; hardly had these men, who are described as
so patient for two centuries, betrayed their fury
at the beginning of the fourth century, than controversy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
gave birth to those civil discords which,
succeeding each other without a moment of relaxation,
still agitate Europe. What are the subjects
of these bloody quarrels? Subtilties, my brethren,
of which not a trace is to be found in the Gospel.
They would know whether the Son was engendered
or made; whether he was engendered in time or
before time; whether he is consubstantial with, or
like, the Father; whether the divine “monad,” as
Athanasius puts it, is threefold in three hypostases;
whether the Holy Ghost was engendered, or proceeded;
whether he proceeds from the Father only,
or the Father and the Son; whether Jesus had one
will or two, or two natures, or one or two persons.</p>

<p>In a word, from “consubstantiality” to “transubstantiation”&mdash;terms
equally difficult to pronounce
and to understand&mdash;everything has been a matter
of dispute, and every dispute has caused torrents
of blood to flow.</p>

<p>You know how much was shed by our superstitious
Mary, daughter of the tyrant Henry VIII., and
worthy spouse of the Spanish tyrant Philip II. The
throne of Charles I. became a scaffold; he perished
ignominiously, after more than two hundred thousand
men had been slaughtered for a liturgy.</p>

<p>You know the civil wars of France. A troop of
fanatical theologians, called the Sorbonne, declare
Henry III. to have forfeited the throne, and at once
a theological apprentice assassinates him. The Sorbonne
declares the great Henry IV., our ally, incapable
of ruling, and twenty murderers rise in
succession; until at last, on the mere announcement
that the hero is about to protect his former allies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
against the Pope’s followers, a monk&mdash;a schoolmaster&mdash;plunges
a knife in the heart of the most
valiant of kings and best of men in the midst of
his capital, under the eyes of his people, and in the
arms of his friends. And, by an inconceivable contradiction,
his memory is revered for ever, and the
troop of the Sorbonne which proscribed and excommunicated
him and his faithful subjects, and
has no right to excommunicate anybody, still survives,
to the shame of France.</p>

<p>It is not the ordinary people, my brethren, not
the agricultural workers and the ignorant and peaceful
artisans, who have raised these ridiculous and
fatal quarrels, the sources of so many horrors and
parricides. There is, unhappily, not one of them
that is not due to the theologians. Men fed by your
labours in a comfortable idleness, enriched by your
sweat and your misery, struggled for partisans and
slaves; they inspired you with a destructive fanaticism,
that they might be your masters; they made
you superstitious, not that you might fear God the
more, but that you might fear them.</p>

<p>The gospel did not say to James, Peter, or Bartholomew:
“Live in opulence; deck yourselves with
honours; walk amid a retinue of guards.” It did
not say to them: “Disturb the world with your
incomprehensible questions.” Jesus, my brethren,
touched none of these questions. Would you be
better theologians than he whom you recognise as
your one master? What! He said to you: “All
consists in loving God and your neighbour”; yet
you would seek something else.</p>

<p>Is there any one among you, is there any one on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the whole earth, who can think that God will examine
him on points of theology, not judge him by
his deeds?</p>

<p>What is a theological opinion? It is an idea
that may be true or false; but morality has no
interest in it. It is clear that you should be virtuous,
whether the Holy Ghost proceeds from the
Father by spiration, or from the Father and the
Son. It is not less clear that you will never understand
any proposition of this nature. You will
never have the least idea how Jesus could have two
natures and two wills in one person. If he had
wished you to know it, he would have told you of
it. I choose these examples among a hundred
others, and I pass in silence over other controversies
in order that I may not reopen wounds that still
bleed.</p>

<p>God has given you understanding; he cannot wish
that you should pervert it. How could a proposition
of which you can never have an idea be necessary
to you? It is a fact of daily experience that God,
who gives everything, has given one man more light
and more talent than another. It does not offend
our good sense that he has chosen to link one man
more closely to himself than others; that he has
made him a model of reason or virtue. No one
can deny that it is possible for God to shower his
finest gifts on one of his works. We may, therefore,
believe in Jesus as one who taught and practised
virtue; but let us take care that in wishing to
go too far beyond that, we do not overturn the
whole structure.</p>

<p>The superstitious man puts poison in the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
wholesome food; he is an enemy to himself and
others. He believes himself the object of eternal
vengeance if he eats meat on a certain day; he believes
that a long, grey robe, with a pointed hood
and a long beard, is much more agreeable to God
than a shaven face and a head that retains its
hair; he imagines that his salvation is bound up
with certain Latin formulæ which he does not understand.
He has educated his daughter in these
principles. She buries herself in a dungeon as soon
as she reaches a marriageable age; she betrays posterity
to please God&mdash;more guilty, in regard to the
human race, than the Hindoo widow, who casts herself
on her husband’s pyre after bearing him children.</p>

<p>Monks of the southern parts of Europe, self-condemned
to a life that is as abject as it is frightful,
do not compare yourselves to the penitents of
the banks of the Ganges; your austerities do not
approach their voluntary sufferings. And think not
that God approves in you what you say he condemns
in them.</p>

<p>The superstitious man is his own executioner;
and he is the executioner of all who do not agree
with him. The most infamous informing he calls
“fraternal correction.” He accuses the simple innocence
that is not on its guard, and, in the candour
of its heart, has not set a seal upon its lips.
He denounces it to those tyrants of souls who laugh
alike at the accused and the accuser.</p>

<p>Lastly, the superstitious man becomes a fanatic,
and then his zeal becomes capable of all crimes in
the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>We live no longer, it is true, in those abominable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
days when relatives and friends slaughtered each
other, when a hundred battles covered the earth
with corpses for the sake of some argument of the
school; but a few sparks spring every day from the
ashes of these vast conflagrations. Princes no
longer march to the field at the voice of priests
and monks; but citizens persecute each other still
in the heart of the towns, and private life is often
poisoned with superstition. What would you say
of a family whose members were ever ready to
fight each other in order to settle in what way
their father must be saluted? My friends, the
great thing is to love him; you may salute him as
you will. Are you brothers only to be divided?
Must that which should unite you be always a
thing to separate you?</p>

<p>I know not of a single civil war among the Turks
on the ground of religion. I say “civil war”; but
history tells of no sedition or trouble among them
that was due to controversy. Is it because they
have fewer pretexts for disputes? Is it because
they are by birth less restless and wiser than we?
They ask not to what sect you belong, provided that
you pay regularly the slight tax. Latin Christians
and Greek Christians, Jacobites, Monothelites,
Copts, or Protestants&mdash;all are welcome to them;
whereas there are not three Christian nations that
practise this humanity.</p>

<p>Jesus, my brethren, was not superstitious or intolerant;
he said not a single word against the cult
of the Romans, who surrounded his country. Let
us imitate his indulgence, and deserve to experience
it from others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>

<p>Let us not be disturbed by the barbaric argument
that is often used. I will give it in its full strength:</p>

<p>“You believe that a good man may find favour
in the eyes of the being of beings, the God of justice
and mercy, at any time, in any place, in whatever
religion he has spent his short life. We, on the
contrary, say that a man cannot please God unless
he be born among us, or taught by us. It is proved
to us that we are the only persons in the world
who are right. We know that, although God came
upon the earth and died for all men, he will nevertheless
show pity only to our little gathering, and
that even among us there are very few who will
escape eternal torment. Adopt the safer side, then.
Enter our little body, and strive to be one of the
elect among us.”</p>

<p>Let us thank our brethren who use this language.
Let us congratulate them on being so sure that all
in the world are damned except a few of themselves;
and let us conclude that our sect is better
than theirs by the very fact that it is more reasonable
and humane. The man who says to me, “Believe
as I do, or God will damn thee,” will presently
say, “Believe as I do, or I shall assassinate thee.”
Let us pray God to soften these atrocious hearts
and inspire all his children with a feeling of brotherhood.
We live in an island in which the episcopal
sect dominates from Dover to the Tweed.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> From
there to the last of the Orkneys presbyterianism
holds the field, and beside these dominant religions
are ten or a dozen others. Go to Italy, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
will find papal despotism on the throne. In France
it is otherwise; France is already regarded by Rome
as half-heretical. Pass to Switzerland and Germany.
You sleep to-night in a Calvinistic town,
to-morrow night in a Papist town, and the following
night in a Lutheran. You go on to Russia, and
find nothing of all this. It is a different sect. The
court is illumined by an empress-philosopher. The
august Catherine has put reason on the throne,
with magnificence and generosity: but the people of
her provinces detest alike the Lutherans, Calvinists,
and Papists. They would not eat, nor drink in the
same glass, with any of them. I ask you, my
brethren, what would happen if, in an assembly of
all these sectaries, each thought himself authorised
by the divine spirit to secure the triumph of his
opinions? See you not the swords drawn, the gibbets
raised, the fires lit, from one end of Europe to
the other? Who is right in this chaos of disputes?
Surely the tolerant and beneficent. Do not say that
in preaching tolerance we preach indifference. No,
my brethren, he who worships God and serves men
is not indifferent. The name is more fitting for the
superstitious who thinks that God will be pleased
with him for uttering unintelligible formulæ, while
he is really very indifferent to the lot of his brother,
whom he leaves to perish without aid, or abandons
in disgrace, or flatters in prosperity, or persecutes
if he is of another sect, unsupported and unprotected.
The more the superstitious man concentrates
upon absurd beliefs and practices, the more
indifferent he becomes to the real needs of humanity.
Let us remember one of our charitable compatriots.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
He founded a hospital for old men in
his province. He was asked if it was for Papists,
Lutherans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Socinians, Anabaptists,
Methodists, or Memnonists? He answered:
For men.</p>

<p>O God, keep from us the error of atheism which
denies thy existence, and deliver us from the superstition
that outrages thy existence and fills ours
with horror.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OLD_TESTAMENT">ON THE INTERPRETATION OF

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Brethren</span>:</p>

<p>Books rule the world, or, at least, those nations
in it which have written language; the others do
not count. The Zend Avesta, attributed to the first
Zoroaster, was the law of the Persians. The Veda
and the Shastabad are the law of the Brahmans.
The Egyptians were ruled by the books of Thot,
who has been called “the first Mercury.” The
Koran holds sway to-day over Africa, Egypt, Arabia,
India, part of Tartary, the whole of Persia, Scythia,
Asia Minor, Syria, Thrace, Thessaly, and the whole
of Greece as far as the strait which separates Naples
and the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The Pentateuch controls the
Jews; and, by a singular dispensation of Providence,
it rules us to-day. It is, therefore, our duty
to read this work together, since it is the foundation
of our faith.</p>

<p>When we read the early chapters of the Pentateuch,
we must remember that, in speaking thus to
the Jews, God deigned to accommodate himself to
their intelligence, which was still very crude. It
is well known to-day that our earth is but a point
in comparison with the space which we, improperly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
call the heavens, in which shine a prodigious number
of stars, with planets far superior to ours. We
know that light was not made before the day, and
that it comes to us from the sun. We know that
the supposed solid expanse between the upper and
the lower waters, which is called the “firmament,”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
is an error of ancient physics, adopted by
the Greeks. But as God was speaking to the Jews,
he deigned to stoop low enough to adopt their language.
Certainly no one would have understood
him in the desert of Horeb if he had said: “I have
put the sun in the centre of your world; the little
globe of the earth revolves, with other planets, round
this great star, which illumines the planets; and the
moon turns round the earth in the course of a
month. Those other stars which you see are so
many suns, presiding over other worlds.”</p>

<p>If the eternal geometrician had spoken thus, he
would indeed have spoken worthily, as a master
who knows his own work; but no Jew would have
understood a word of such sublime truths. The
Jewish people were stiff of neck and hard of understanding.
It was necessary to give coarse food to
a coarse people, which could find sustenance only
in such food. It seems that this first chapter of
<cite>Genesis</cite> was an allegory presented to them by the
Holy Spirit, to be interpreted some day by those
whom God would deign to fill with his light. That,
at least, was the idea of the leading Jews, since it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
was forbidden to read this book before reaching
one’s twenty-fifth year, in order that the mind of
young folk might be prepared by masters to read
it with more intelligence and respect.</p>

<p>These doctors taught that, in the literal sense,
the Nile, Euphrates, Tigris, and Araxes did not
really rise in the terrestrial paradise; but that the
four rivers, which watered it, evidently meant four
virtues necessary to man. It was, according to
them, clear that the formation of woman from the
rib of man was a most striking allegory of the
unvarying harmony that ought to be found in marriage;
that the souls of married people ought to be
united like their bodies. It is a symbol of the peace
and fidelity that ought to rule in conjugal society.</p>

<p>The serpent that seduced Eve, and was the most
cunning of all animals on the earth, is, if we are
to believe Philo and other writers, a figurative expression
of our corrupt desires. The use of speech,
which Scripture assigns to it, is the voice of our
passions speaking to our hearts. God used the
allegory of the serpent because it was very common
in the East. The serpent was considered subtle
because it quickly escapes those who pursue it,
and skilfully falls on those who attack it. Its
change of skin was the symbol of immortality. The
Egyptians carried a silver serpent in their processions.
The Phœnicians, who were neighbours of
the Hebrews, had long had an allegorical fable of
a serpent that had made war on God and man.
In fine, the serpent which tempted Eve has been
recognised as the devil, who is ever seeking to
tempt and undo us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<p>It is true that the idea of a devil falling from
heaven and becoming the enemy of the human race
was known to the Jews only in the course of time;
but the divine author, who knew that this idea
would spread some day, deigned to plant the seed
of it in the early chapters of <cite>Genesis</cite>.</p>

<p>We really know nothing of the fall of the wicked
angels except from these few words in the Epistle
of St. Jude: “Wandering stars, to whom is reserved
the blackness of darkness for ever, of whom
Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied.”
It has been thought that these wandering stars were
the angels transformed into malevolent demons, and
we supply the place of the prophecies of Enoch, the
seventh man after Adam, which we no longer have.
But no matter into what labyrinth learned men may
wander, in trying to explain these incomprehensible
things, we must always understand in an edifying
sense whatever we cannot understand literally.</p>

<p>The ancient Brahmans, as we said, had this
theology many centuries before the Jewish nation
came into existence. The ancient Persians had
given names to the devils long before the Jews did
so. You are aware that in the Pentateuch we do
not find the name of any angel, good or bad. There
is no mention of Gabriel, or Raphael, or Satan, or
Asmodeus in the Jewish books until long afterwards,
when the little people had learned their
names during the Babylonian captivity [or the Persian
domination]. That shows, at least, that the
doctrine of celestial and infernal beings was common
to all great nations. You will find it in the
book of <cite>Job</cite>, a precious monument of antiquity. Job<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
is an Arabic character; if the allegory was written
in Arabic. There are still, in the Hebrew translation,
purely Arabic phrases.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Here, then, we have
the Hindoos, Persians, Arabs, and Jews successively
adopting much the same theology. It is therefore
entitled to close attention.</p>

<p>But what is even more clearly entitled to our
attention is the morality that ought to result from
all this ancient theology. Men, who are not born
to be murderers, since God has not armed them like
lions and tigers; who are not born to be imposed
upon, since they all necessarily love truth; who are
not born to be marauding brigands, since God has
given equally to them all the fruits of the earth and
the wool of the sheep; but who have, nevertheless,
become marauders, perjurers, and murderers, are
really angels transformed into demons.</p>

<p>Let us, my brethren, always seek in Holy Writ
what morality, not what physics, teaches.</p>

<p>Let the ingenious Father Calmet employ his profound
sagacity and penetrating logic in discovering
the place of the earthly paradise; we may be content
to deserve, if we can, the heavenly paradise by
the practice of justice, toleration, and kindliness.</p>

<p>“But of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that
thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die” (<cite>Gen.</cite>,
ii., 17).</p>

<p>Interpreters admit that we do not know of any
tree that gives knowledge. Adam did not die on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
the day on which he ate of it; he lived for nine
hundred and thirty years afterwards, the Scripture
says. But, alas, what are nine hundred years between
two eternities! They are not to be compared
with a moment of time, and our days pass like the
shadow. Does not this allegory, however, clearly
teach us that knowledge, wrongly understood, is
able to undo us? The tree of knowledge bears, no
doubt, very bitter fruit, since so many learned theologians
have been persecutors or persecuted, and
many have died a dreadful death. <ins class="corr" id="tn107" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Ah, my brethren, the Holy Sprit” changed to “Ah, my brethren, the Holy Spirit”.">Ah, my brethren, the Holy Spirit</ins>
wished to show us how dangerous false science is, how it puffs up the
heart, and how absurd a learned doctor often is.</p>

<p>It is from this passage that St. Augustine gathered
the guilt of all men on account of the disobedience
of the first man. He it is who developed
the doctrine of original sin. Whether the stain of
this sin corrupted our bodies, or steeped the souls
which enter them, is an entirely incomprehensible
mystery; it warns us at least not to live in crime,
if we were born in crime.</p>

<p>“And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any
finding him should kill him” (<cite>Gen.</cite> iv.).</p>

<p>Here, especially, my brethren, the fathers are
opposed to each other. The family of Adam was
not yet numerous; Scripture gives him no other
children than Abel and Cain, at the time when the
former was murdered by his brother. Why is God
forced to give Cain a safeguard against any who
may find him? Let us be content to observe that
God pardons Cain, no doubt after filling him with
remorse. Let us profit by the lesson, and not condemn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
our brethren to frightful torments for small
causes. When God is so merciful as to forgive an
abominable murder, we may imitate him. The objection
is raised that the same God who pardons
a cruel murderer damns all men for ever for the
transgression of Adam, whose only crime was to
eat the forbidden fruit. To our feeble human reason
it seems unjust for God to punish eternally all
the children of the guilty, not indeed to atone for
a murder, but to expiate what seems an excusable
act of disobedience. This is said to be an intolerable
contradiction, which we cannot admit in an
infinitely good being; but it is only an apparent
contradiction. God hands us over, with our parents
and children, to the flames for the disobedience of
Adam; but four thousand years afterwards he sends
Jesus Christ to deliver us, and he preserves the
life of Cain in order to people the earth: thus he
remains in all things the God of justice and mercy.
St. Augustine calls Adam’s sin a “fortunate fault”;
but that of Cain was still more fortunate, since
God took care himself to put a mark of his protection
on him.</p>

<p>“A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in
a cubit shalt thou finish it above,” etc. (<cite>Gen.</cite> vi. 16).</p>

<p>Here we reach the greatest of all miracles, before
which reason must humble itself and the heart must
break. We know with what bold contempt the incredulous
rise against the prodigy of a universal
deluge.</p>

<p>It is fruitless for them to object that in the wettest
years we do not get thirty inches of rain; that
even in such a year there are as many regions without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
rain as there are flooded regions; that the law
of gravity prevents the ocean from overflowing its
bounds; that if it covered the earth it would leave
its bed dry; that, even if it covered the earth, it
could not rise fifteen cubits above the highest
mountains; that the animals could not reach the
ark from America and southern lands; that seven
pairs of clean animals and two pairs of unclean
could not have been put in twenty arks;
that these twenty arks would not have sufficed to
hold the fodder they needed, not merely for ten
months, but for the following year, in which the
earth would be too sodden to produce; that the
carnivorous animals would have died of starvation;
that the eight persons in the ark would not have
been able to give the animals their food every day.
There is no end to their difficulties. But the whole
of them are solved by pointing out that this great
event was a miracle&mdash;that puts an end to all dispute.</p>

<p>“And they said, Go to, let us build us a city
and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and
let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad
upon the face of the whole earth” (<cite>Gen.</cite> xi. 4).</p>

<p>Unbelievers declare that it is possible to make a
name, yet be scattered abroad. They ask if men
have ever been so stupid as to wish to build a
tower as high as the heavens. They say that such
a tower would rise into the atmosphere, and that,
if you call the atmosphere the heavens, the tower
will necessarily be in the heavens if it were no more
than twenty feet high; and that, if all men then
spoke the same tongue, the wisest thing they could
do would be to gather in a common city and prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
a corruption of their tongue. Apparently they
were all in their own country, since they were all
agreed to build therein. To drive them from their
country is tyrannical; to make them suddenly speak
new tongues is absurd. Hence, they say, we can
only regard the story of the tower of Babel as an
oriental romance.</p>

<p>I reply to this blasphemy that, since the miracle
is described by an author who has recorded so many
other miracles, it ought to be believed, like the
others. The works of God cannot be expected to
resemble the works of man in any way. The ages
of the patriarchs and prophets can have no relation
to the ages of ordinary men. God now comes upon
the earth no more; but in those days he often came
down to carry out his work in person. It is a tradition
of all the great nations of antiquity. The
Greeks, who had no knowledge of the Jewish books
until long after they had been translated into Greek
at Alexandria by Hellenising Jews, had believed,
before Homer and Hesiod, that the great Zeus and
all the other gods came down from the upper air
to visit the earth. What lesson may we derive from
the general acceptance of this idea? That we are
always in the presence of God, and that we must
engage in no deed or thought that is not in accord
with his justice. In a word, the tower of Babel is
no more extraordinary than all the rest. The book
is equally authentic in all its parts; we cannot
deny one fact without denying all the others. We
must bring our proud reason into subjection,
whether we regard the story as literally true or
as a figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<p>“In the same day the Lord made a covenant with
Abraham, saying: Unto thy seed have I given this
land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river,
the river Euphrates” (<cite>Gen.</cite> xv., 18).</p>

<p>Unbelievers exclaim triumphantly that the Jews
have never owned more than a part of what God
promised them. They even think it unjust that the
Lord gave them this part. They say that the Jews
had not the least right to it; that the former journey
of a Chaldæan into a barbaric country could
not possibly be a legitimate pretext for invading the
country; and that any man who declared himself
a descendant of St. Patrick, and came on that account
to sack Ireland, saying that he had God’s
order to do so, would meet with a warm reception.
But let us always remember that the times have
changed. Let us respect the books of the Jews, and
take care not to imitate the Jews. God enjoins no
longer what he once commanded.</p>

<p>They ask who this Abraham is, and why the Jewish
people is traced to the Chaldæan son of an
idolatrous potter, who had no relation to the people
of the land of Canaan, and could not understand
their language. This Chaldæan, accompanied by a
wife who bends under the weight of years, but is
still good, reaches Memphis. Why do the couple
pass from Memphis to the desert of Gerar? How
comes there to be a king in this horrible desert?
How is it that the king of Egypt and the king of
Gerar both fall in love with the aged<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> spouse of
Abraham? These are but historical difficulties; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
great thing is to obey God. Holy Scripture always
represents Abraham as unreservedly submissive to
the will of the Most High. Let us imitate him, and
not dispute so much.</p>

<p>“And there came two angels to Sodom at even,”
etc. (<cite>Gen.</cite> xix.).</p>

<p>Here is a stumbling-block for all readers who
listen only to their own reason. Two angels&mdash;that
is to say, two spiritual creatures, two heavenly
ministers of God&mdash;have earthly bodies, and inspire
a whole town, even its old men, with infamous desires;
a father of a family prostitutes his two
daughters to save the honour of the two angels; a
town is changed into a lake of fire; a woman is
transformed into a salt statue; two girls deceive
and intoxicate their father in order to commit incest
with him, lest, they say, their race should
perish, while they have all the inhabitants of the
town of Zoar to choose from! All these events,
taken together, make up a revolting picture. But
if we are reasonable we shall agree with St. Clement
of Alexandria and the fathers who have
followed him that the whole is allegorical.</p>

<p>Let us remember that that was the way of writing
in the East. Parables were so constantly used
that even the author of all truth spoke to the Jews
only in parables when he came on earth.</p>

<p>Parables make up the whole of the profane theology
of antiquity. Saturn devouring his children is
evidently time destroying its own works. Minerva
is wisdom; she is formed in the head of the master
of the gods. The arrows and bandage of Cupid are
obvious figures. The fall of Phaëthon is an admirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
symbol of ambition. All is not allegory, either in
the pagan theology or in the sacred history of the
Jewish people. The fathers distinguish between
what is purely historical and purely parabolical,
and what partakes of the nature of each. It is, I
grant, difficult to walk on these slippery paths; but
if we walk in the way of virtue, why need we
concern ourselves about that of science?</p>

<p>The crime that God punishes here is horrible;
let that suffice us. Lot’s wife was changed into a
salt statue for looking behind her. Let us curb the
impulses of curiosity; in a word, let the stories of
Holy Writ serve to make us better, if they do not
make us more enlightened.</p>

<p>There are, it seems to me, my brethren, two kinds
of figurative and mystic interpretation of the Scriptures.
The first, and incomparably the better, is to
gather from all facts counsels for the conduct of
life. If Jacob cruelly wrongs his brother Esau and
deceives his father-in-law Laban, let us keep peace
in our families and act justly towards our relatives.
If the patriarch Reuben dishonours his father’s bed,
let us regard the incest with horror. If the patriarch
Judah commits a still more odious incest with
his daughter-in-law Thamar, let us all the more detest
these iniquities. When David ravishes the wife
of Uriah, and has the husband slain; when Solomon
murders his brother; when we find that nearly all the
petty kings of the Jews are murderous barbarians,
let us mend our ways as we read this awful list of
crimes. Let us read the whole Bible in this spirit.
It discomposes the man who would be learned; it
consoles the man who is content to be good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>The other way to detect the hidden meaning of
the Scriptures is to regard each event as an historical
and physical emblem. That was the method
followed by St. Clement, the great Origen, the respectable
St. Augustine, and so many other fathers.
According to them, the piece of red cloth which the
harlot Rahab hung from her window is the blood
of Jesus Christ. Moses spreading out his arms
foreshadows the sign of the cross. Judah tying his
ass to a vine prefigures the entrance of Christ into
Jerusalem. St. Augustine compares the ark of
Noah to Jesus. St. Ambrose, in the seventh book
of his <cite>De Arca</cite>, says that the making of the little
door in the side of the ark signifies, or may be regarded
as signifying, a part of the human body.
Even if all these interpretations were true, what
profit should we derive from them? Will men be
juster from knowing what the little door of the
ark means? This way of interpreting the Holy
Scripture is but a subtlety of the mind, and it may
injure the innocence of the heart.</p>

<p>Let us set aside all the subjects of contention
which divide nations, and fill ourselves with the
sentiments which unite them. Submission to God,
resignation, justice, kindness, compassion, and
tolerance&mdash;those are the great principles. May all the
theologians of the earth live together as men of
business do. Asking not of what country a man
is, nor in what practices he was reared, they observe
towards each other the inviolable rules of equity,
fidelity, and mutual confidence; and by these principles
they bind nations together. But those who
know only their own opinions, and condemn all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
others; those who think that the light shines for
them alone, and all other men walk in darkness;
<ins class="corr" id="tn115" title="Transcriber’s Note—“those who scruple to commnicate with foreign religions” changed to “those who scruple to communicate with foreign religions”.">those who scruple to communicate with foreign religions</ins>,
should surely be entitled enemies of the human race.</p>

<p>I will not conceal from you that the most learned
men affirm that the Pentateuch was not written by
Moses. The great Newton, who alone discovered
the first principle of nature and the nature of light,
the astounding genius who penetrated so deep into
ancient history, attributes the Pentateuch to Samuel.
Other distinguished scholars think that it was written
in the time of Osias by the scribe Saphan;
others believe that Esdras wrote it, on returning
from the Captivity. All are agreed, together with
certain modern Jews, that the work was not written
by Moses.</p>

<p>This great objection is not as formidable as it
seems. We assuredly respect the Decalogue, from
whatever hand it came. We dispute about the date
of several laws which some attribute to Edward III.,
others to Edward II.; but we do not hesitate to
adopt the laws, because we perceive that they are
just and useful. Even if those statements in the
preamble that are called in question are rejected,
we do not reject the law.</p>

<p>Let us always distinguish between dogma and history,
and between dogma and that eternal morality
which all legislators have taught and all peoples
received.</p>

<p>O holy morality! O God who has created it! I
will not confine you within the bounds of a province.
You reign over all thinking and sentient beings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
You are the God of Jacob; but you are the
God of the universe.</p>

<p>I cannot end this discourse, my dear brethren,
without speaking to you of the prophets. This is
one of the large subjects on which our enemies think
to confound us. They say that in ancient times
every people had its prophets, diviners, or seers.
But does it follow that because the Egyptians, for
instance, formerly had false prophets the Jews may
not have had true prophets? It is said that they
had no mission, no rank, no legal authorisation.
That is true; but may they not have been authorised
by God? They anathematised each other,
and treated each other as rogues and fools; the
prophet Zedekiah even dared to strike the prophet
Michah in the presence of King Josaphat.
We do not deny it; the Paralipomena record the
fact. But is a ministry less holy because the
ministers disgrace it? Have not our priests done
things a hundred times worse than the giving of
blows?</p>

<p>The commandments of God to the prophets Ezekiel
and Hosea scandalise those who think themselves
wise. Will they not be wiser if they see that these
are allegories, types, parables, in accordance with
the ways of the Israelites? And that we have no
more right to ask of God an account of the orders
he gives in accordance with these ways than to
ask the people why they have them? No doubt God
could not order a prophet to commit debauch and
adultery; but he wished to let us see that he disapproved
the crimes and adulteries of his chosen
people. If we did not read the Bible in this spirit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
we should, alas, be filled with horror and indignation
at every page.</p>

<p>Let us find edification in what scandalises others;
let us find wholesome food in their poison. When
the proper and literal meaning of a passage seems
to be in accord with reason, let us keep to it. When
it seems to be contrary to the truth or to sound
morals, let us seek a hidden meaning that may
reconcile truth and sound morals with Holy Scripture.
Thus have all the fathers of the Church proceeded;
thus do we proceed daily in the commerce
of life. We always interpret favourably the discourses
of our friends and partisans. Would we
treat more harshly the sacred books of the Jews,
which are the object of our faith? Let us, in fine,
read the Jews’ books that we may be Christians;
and if they make us not more wise, let them at
least make us better.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NEW_TESTAMENT">ON THE INTERPRETATION OF
THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Brethren</span>:</p>

<p>There are in the New Testament, as there are in
the Old, depths that we cannot sound, and sublimities
that our poor reason can never attain. I
do not propose here either to reconcile the gospels,
which seem to contradict each other at times, or to
explain mysteries which, by the very fact that they
are mysteries, must be inexplicable. Let those who
are more learned than I discuss whether the Holy
Family betook itself to Egypt after the massacre of
the children at Bethlehem, as Matthew says, or remained
in Judæa, as Luke says; let them seek if
the father of Joseph was named Jacob, his grandfather
Matthan, and his great-grandfather Eleazar,
or if his great-grandfather was Levi, his grandfather
Matthat, and his father Heli. Let them settle
this genealogical tree according to their light; it is
a study that I respect. I know not if it would
enlighten my mind, but I do know that it cannot
speak to my heart. Paul the Apostle tells us himself,
in his first epistle to Timothy, that we must
not trouble ourselves about genealogies. We will
not be any the better for knowing precisely who
were the ancestors of Joseph, in what year Jesus
was born, and whether James was his brother or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
his cousin. What will it profit us to consult what
remains of the Roman annals to see if Augustus
really did order a census of all the peoples of the
earth when Mary was pregnant with Jesus, Quirinus
governor of Syria, and Herod king of Judæa?
Quirinus, whom Luke calls Cyrenius, was (the
learned say) not governor in the time of Herod,
but of Archelaus, ten years later; and Augustus
never ordered a census of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>We are told that the <cite>Epistle to the Hebrews</cite>,
attributed to Paul, was not written by Paul; that
neither <cite>Revelation</cite> nor the <cite>Gospel of John</cite> was
written by John; that the first chapter of this
gospel was evidently written by a Greek Platonist;
that the book could not possibly come from a Jew;
and that no Jew could ever have made Jesus say:
“I give you a new commandment: that you love
each other.” This commandment, they say, was
certainly not new. It is given expressly, and in
even stronger terms, in the laws of <cite>Leviticus</cite>:
“Thou shalt love thy God above all things, and
thy neighbour as thyself.” Such a man as Jesus
Christ&mdash;a man learned in the law, who confounded
the doctors at the age of twelve, and was ever
speaking of the law&mdash;could not be ignorant of the
law; and his beloved disciple could not possibly
have charged him with so palpable a mistake.</p>

<p>Let us not be troubled, my brethren. Let us remember
that Jesus spoke a dialect, half Syrian and
half Phœnician, that was hardly intelligible to
Greeks; that we have the <cite>Gospel of John</cite> only in
Greek; that this gospel was written more than fifty
years after the death of Jesus; that the copyists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
may easily have altered the text; and that it is
more probable that the text ran, “I give you a
commandment that is not new,” than that it said:
“I give you a new commandment.” Let us return
to our great principle. The precept is good; it is
our duty to fulfil it as well as we may, whether or
no Zoroaster was the first to announce it, and Moses
copied it, and Jesus renewed it.</p>

<p>Shall we penetrate into the thickest darkness of
antiquity to learn whether the darkness which covered
the whole earth at the death of Jesus was
due to an eclipse of the sun at a time of full moon,
whether an astronomer named Phlegon, whom we
have no longer, spoke of this phenomenon, or if
any one ever saw the star of the three wise men?
These are difficulties that may very well interest
an antiquarian; but he will not have spent in good
works the precious time he devotes to the clearing-up
of this chaos; and he will end with more doubt
than piety. My brethren, the man who shares his
bread with the poor is better than he who has compared
the Hebrew text with the Greek, and both of
them with the Samaritan.</p>

<p>All that relates to history only gives rise to a
thousand disputes; what concerns our duties gives
rise to none. You will never understand how the
devil took God into the desert; how he tempted
him for forty days; or how he carried him to the
top of a hill from which he could see all the kingdoms
of the world. The devil offering all these
things to God will greatly shock you. You will
seek the mystery that is hidden in these things,
and so many others, and your mind will be fatigued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
in vain. Every word will plunge you into uncertainty,
and the anguish of a restless curiosity which
can never be satisfied. But if you confine your
attention to morals the storm will pass, and you
will rest in the bosom of virtue.</p>

<p>I venture to flatter myself, my brethren, that if
the greatest enemies of the Christian religion were
to listen to us in this secluded temple, in which the
love of virtue brings us together; if Lord Herbert,
Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Bolingbroke, Tindal, Toland,
Collins, Whiston, Trenchard, Gordon, and Swift
were to witness our gentle and innocent simplicity,
they would have less disdain and repugnance for
us. They cease not to reproach us with an absurd
fanaticism. We are not fanatical in belonging to
the religion of Jesus. He worshipped one God, as
we do; he despised empty ceremonies, as we do.
No gospel has said that his mother was the mother
of God, or that he was consubstantial with God.
In no gospel will you find that the disciples of
Jesus should arrogate the title of “Holy Father,”
or “My Lord,” or that a priest who lives at Lambeth
should have an income of two thousand a year
while so many useful tillers of the soil have hardly
the seed for the three or four acres they water with
their tears. The gospel did not say to the bishops
of Rome: Forge a donation of Constantine in order
to seize the city of the Scipios and Cæsars and become
sovereigns of Naples. It did not urge the
bishops of Germany to profit by a time of anarchy
to invade half of Germany. Jesus was a poor man
preaching to the poor. What should we say of the
followers of Penn and Fox, those enemies of pomp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
and friends of peace, if they bore golden mitres on
their heads and were surrounded by soldiers; if they
grasped the substance of the peoples; if they would
give orders to kings; if their satellites, with executioners
in their train, were to cry out at the top
of their voices, “Foolish nations, believe in Fox and
Penn, or you will die in torment”?</p>

<p>You know better than I what a fatal contrast
the ages have witnessed between the humility of
Jesus and the pride of those who have assumed his
name; between their avarice and his poverty, their
debauches and his chastity, his submissiveness and
their bloody tyranny.</p>

<p>I confess, my brethren, that no word of his has
made such an impression on me as that which he
spoke to those who were so brutal as to strike him
before he was led to execution: “If I have spoken
well, why do you strike me?” That is what ought
to be said to all persecutors. If my opinion differs
from yours on things that it is impossible to understand;
if I see the mercy of God where you would
see only his power; if I have said that all the disciples
of Jesus were equal, while you have thought
it your duty to trample on them; if I have worshipped
God alone while you have given him
associates; if I have spoken ill in differing from
you, bear witness of the evil; and if I have spoken
well, why do you heap on me your insults and
epithets? Why do you persecute me, cast me in
irons, deliver me to torture and flames, and insult
me even after my death? If, indeed, I had spoken
ill, it was yours only to pity and instruct me. You
are confident that you are infallible, that your opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
is divine, that the gates of hell will never prevail
against it, that the whole world will one day embrace
your opinion, that the world will be subject
to you, and that you will rule from Mount Atlas
to the islands of Japan. How, then, can my opinion
hurt you? You do not fear me, and you persecute
me! You despise me, and do away with me!</p>

<p>What reply can we make, my brethren, to these
modest and forceful reproaches? Only the reply of
the wolf to the lamb, “You have disturbed the water
that I drink.” Thus have men treated each other&mdash;the
gospel in one hand and sword in the other;
preaching disinterestedness and accumulating treasures,
praising humility and walking on the heads
of prostrate princes, recommending mercy and shedding
human blood.</p>

<p>If these barbarians find in the gospel any parable
that may be distorted in their favour by
fraudulent interpretation, they fasten upon it as
an anvil on which they may forge their murderous
weapons.</p>

<p>Is there a word about two swords hung above a
wall? They arm themselves at once with a hundred
swords. It is said that a king has killed his fatted
beasts, compelled the blind and the lame to come
to his feast, and cast into outer darkness him who
had no wedding garment; is that, my brethren, a
reason that justifies them in putting you in prison
like this guest, tearing your limbs asunder on the
rack, plucking out your eyes to make you blind like
those who were dragged to the feast, or slaying you
as the king slew his fatted beasts? Yet it is to
such equivocal passages that men have so often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
appealed for the right to desolate a large part of
the earth.</p>

<p>Those terrible words, “Not peace, but a sword,
I bring unto you,” have caused more Christians to
perish than ambition has ever sacrificed.</p>

<p>The scattered and unhappy Jews are consoled in
their wretchedness when they see us always fighting
each other from the earliest days of Christianity,
always at war in public or in secret, persecuted
or persecuting, oppressed or oppressing. They are
united, and they laugh at our interminable quarrels.
It seems that we have been concerned only in
avenging them.</p>

<p>Wretches that we are, we insult the pagans, yet
they never knew our theological quarrels; they have
never shed a drop of blood for the interpretation of
a dogma, and we have flooded the earth with it. In
the bitterness of my heart I say to you: Jesus was
persecuted, and whoever shares his thoughts will
be persecuted. What was Jesus in the eyes of men,
who could assuredly have no suspicion of his
divinity? A good man who, having been born in
poverty, spoke to the poor in opposition to the
superstitions of the rich Pharisees and the insolent
priests&mdash;the Socrates of Galilee. You know how
he said to these Pharisees, “Woe unto you, ye blind
guides, which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel!
Woe unto you, for ye make clean the outside of the
cup and of the platter, but within you are full of
extortion and excess” (<cite>Matthew</cite> xxiii.).</p>

<p>He often calls them “whitened sepulchres” and
“race of vipers.” They were, nevertheless, men of
some dignity, and they avenged themselves by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
death. Arnold of Brescia, John Huss, and Jerome
of Prague said much less than this to the pontiffs
of their time, and they, too, were put to death.
Never tilt against the ruling superstition, unless
you be powerful enough to withstand it, or clever
enough to escape its pursuit. The fable of Our
Lady of Loretto is more extravagant than all Ovid’s
metamorphoses, it is true; the miracle of St. Januarius
at Naples is more ridiculous than the miracle
of Egnatia, mentioned by Horace, I agree. But say
aloud at Naples or Loretto what you think of these
absurdities, and it will cost you your life. It is
not so among certain enlightened nations. There
the people have their errors, though they are less
gross; and the least superstitious people are always
the most tolerant.</p>

<p>Cast off all superstition, and be more humane.
But when you speak against fanaticism, anger not
the fanatics; they are delirious invalids, who would
assault their physicians. Let us make their ways
more gentle, not aggravate them. And let us instil,
drop by drop, into their souls that divine balm of
tolerance which they would reject with horror if
offered to them in full.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EPISTLE_TO_THE_ROMANS">EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Translated from the Italian of Count de
Corbera</span>)</p>

<h3 class="allsmcap">ARTICLE I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Illustrious</span> Romans, it is not the Apostle Paul
who has the honour of addressing you. It is not
that worthy Jew who was born at Tarsus, according
to the <cite>Acts of the Apostles</cite>, and at Giscala according
to Jerome and other fathers; a dispute that has
led some to believe that one may be born in two
different places at the same time, just as there are
among you certain bodies which are created by a
few Latin words, and are found in a hundred
thousand places at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>It is not the bald, hot-headed man, with long and
broad nose, black eyebrows, thick and continuous,
and broad shoulders and crooked legs,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> who, having
carried off the daughter of his master Gamaliel, and
being subsequently dissatisfied with her, divorced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
her<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>; and, in pique, if we may believe contemporary
Jewish writers, put himself at the head of the
nascent body of the Christians.</p>

<p>It is not that St. Paul who, when he was a servant
of Gamaliel, had the good Stephen, the patron
of deacons and of those who are stoned, slain with
stones, and who, while it was done, took care of
the cloaks of the murderers&mdash;a fitting employment
for a priest’s valet. It is not he who fell from his
horse, blinded in midday by a heavenly light, and
to whom God said in the air, as he says every day
to so many others: “Why persecutest thou me?”
It is not he who wrote to the half-Jewish, half-Christian
shopkeepers of Corinth: “Have we not
power to eat and to drink ... and to lead about
a sister or a wife? Who goeth to war any time at
his own charge?”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> By those fine words the
Reverend Father Menou, Jesuit and apostle of Lorraine,
profited so well that they brought him, at
Nancy, eighty thousand francs a year, a palace, and
more than one handsome woman.</p>

<p>It is not he who wrote to the little flock in Thessalonica
that the universe was about to be destroyed,
and on that account it was not worth while
keeping money about one. As Paul said: “For the
Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with
the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall
rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall
be caught up together with them.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>

<p>Observe, generous Romans, that St. Paul did but
announce these pleasant things to the tailors and
grocers of Thessalonica in virtue of the express
prophecy of Luke (ch. xxi.), who had publicly&mdash;that
is, to some fifteen or sixteen chosen souls among
the people&mdash;averred that this generation would not
pass away before the son of man came on the clouds
with great power and glory. It is true, O Romans,
that Jesus came not on the clouds with a great
power; but at least the popes have had this great
power, and thus are the prophecies fulfilled.</p>

<p>He who writes this epistle to the Romans is,
again, not that St. Paul, half Jew, half Christian,
who, having preached Jesus and announced the destruction
of the Mosaic law, not only went to
Judaise in the temple of Hershalaim, which the
vulgar call Jerusalem, but, on the advice of his
friend James, observed there certain rigorous practices
which the Holy Inquisition now punishes with
death.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>He who writes to you has been neither priest’s
valet, nor murderer, nor keeper of cloaks, nor apostate,
nor maker of tents, nor buried in the depths
of the sea, like Jonah, for twenty-four hours, nor
caught up to the third heaven, like Elias, without
learning what the third heaven is.</p>

<p>He who writes to you is more a citizen than this
Saul Paul, who, it is said, boasted of being one,
and assuredly was not. For Tarsus, if he came
from there, was not made a Roman colony until
the time of Caracalla [211-217 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>]; and Giscala<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
in Galilee, from which it is more probable that he
came, since he was of the tribe of Benjamin, was
certainly not a Roman town. Roman citizenship
was not bestowed on Jews at Tarsus or anywhere
else. The author of the <cite>Acts of the Apostles</cite> (xvi.,
37) asserts that this Jew Paul and another Jew
named Silas were arrested by the authorities in the
town of Philippi in Macedonia (a town founded by
the father of Alexander, near which the battle between
Cassius and Brutus, on the one side, and
Antony and Octavian, on the other, decided the fate
of your empire). Paul and Silas were scourged for
stirring up the populace, and Paul said to the
officers: “They have beaten us, being Romans”
(<cite>Acts</cite> xvi., 37). Commentators freely admit that
Silas was not a Roman citizen. They do not say
that the author of <cite>Acts</cite> lied, but they agree that
what he says is untrue; and I am sorry for the
Holy Spirit, who, no doubt, dictated the <cite>Acts of
the Apostles</cite>.</p>

<p>In fine, he who now writes to the descendants of
Marcellus, the Scipios, the Catos, Cicero, Titus, and
the Antonines, is a Roman gentleman of an ancient
and transplanted family, one who cherishes his venerable
country, bemoans her condition, and has left
his heart in her Capitol.</p>

<p>Romans, listen to your fellow-citizen; listen to
Rome and your ancient valour.</p>

<p><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">L’Italico valor non è ancor morto.</i></p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ARTICLE II.</h3>

<p>When I travelled among you, I wept to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
Zocolanti occupying that very Capitol to which
Paulus Emilus led King Perseus, the descendant of
Alexander, chained to his triumphal car; that
temple to which the Scipios had brought the spoils
of Carthage, and in which Pompey triumphed over
Asia, Africa, and Europe. But even more bitter
were my tears when I recalled the feast that
Cæsar spread for our ancestors on twenty-two
thousand tables, and when I compared the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">congiaria</i>,
that immense free distribution of corn,
with the scanty and poor bread that you eat
to-day, sold to you at so high a price by the apostolic
chamber. Alas! you cannot even sow your soil
without the permission of these apostles; and, indeed,
what have you with which to sow it? There
is not a citizen among you, save a few that live in
the Trastevere quarter, who has a plough. Your God
fed five thousand men, to say nothing of the women
and children, with five loaves and two gudgeons,
according to St. John; four thousand men, according
to Matthew.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> You, Romans, are made to swallow
the gudgeon<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> without receiving any bread. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
successors of Lucullus are reduced to the holy
practice of fasting.</p>

<p>Your climate has never changed, whatever be said
to the contrary. Who, then, has so greatly changed
your soil, your fortunes, and your spirit? Whence
comes it that the whole country from the gates of
Rome to Ostia is inhabited only by reptiles? Why
do we find that, from Montefiascone to Viterbo, and
in the whole region through which the Appian Way
still leads to Naples, a vast desert has replaced the
smiling land that was once covered with palaces,
gardens, harvests, and countless numbers of citizens?
I sought the Forum Romanum of Trajan,
that square once paved with reticulated marble,
surrounded by a colonnaded peristyle and adorned
with a hundred statues; and what I found was the
Campo Vacino, the cattle-market, a market of lean
and milkless cows. And I asked myself: Where
are those two million Romans who once peopled this
capital? I found that on the average only 3500
children are now born annually in Rome. Setting
aside Jews, priests, and foreigners, Rome cannot
have one hundred thousand inhabitants. I asked
of them: Whose is this splendid building that I
see, girt about with ruins? It belongs to the monks,
they said. Here once was the house of Augustus;
there Cicero dwelt, and there Pompey. On their
ruins have arisen convents.</p>

<p>I wept, Romans; and I think highly enough of
you to believe that you weep with me.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ARTICLE III.</h3>

<p>It was explained to me that an aged priest, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
has been appointed pope by other priests, cannot
find either the time or the will to relieve your
misery. He can think only of living. What interest
should he take in Romans? He is himself
rarely a Roman. What care should he take of an
estate that will not pass to his children? Rome
is not his patrimony, as it was that of the Cæsars.
It is an ecclesiastical benefice; the papacy is a kind
of commendatory abbey,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which each abbot ruins
while he lives. The Cæsars had a real interest in
seeing Rome flourish; the patricians, under the Republic,
had an even greater interest. No dignities
could be obtained unless the people were won with
benefits, cajoled by the appearance of virtue, or
fired by great victories. A pope shuts himself up
with his money and his unleavened bread, and gives
only his blessing to the people that was once known
as “the People King.”</p>

<p>Your misfortunes began with the transfer of the
Empire of Rome to the bounds of Thrace. Constantine,
chosen emperor by a few barbaric cohorts in
distant England, triumphed over the Maxentius
chosen by you. Maxentius was drowned in the
Tiber in the rout, and left the Empire to his rival.
But the conqueror went to hide himself on the shores
of the Black Sea; he could not have done more if
he had been beaten. Stained with debauch and
crime, murderer of his father-in-law, brother-in-law,
nephew, son, and wife, abhorred by the Romans, he
abandoned the ancient religion under which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
had conquered so many States, and cast himself
into the arms of the Christians who had found the
money to which he owed his crown.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He thus betrayed
the Empire as soon as he obtained it, and,
in transplanting to the Bosphorus the great tree
that had sheltered Europe, Africa, and Asia Minor,
he did fatal injury to its roots.</p>

<p>Your next misfortune was this ecclesiastical
maxim, quoted in a celebrated French poem, “Le
Lutrin,” and very gravely true: “Ruin the world,
if need be; it is the spirit of the Church.” The
Church fought the ancient religion of the Empire,
and tore its own entrails in the struggle, dividing,
with equal fury and imprudence, on a hundred incomprehensible
questions of which none had ever
heard before. The Christian sects, hounding each
other with fire and sword for metaphysical chimæras
and sophisms of the school, united to seize the
spoils of the priesthood founded by Numa. They
did not rest until they had destroyed the altar of
Victory at Rome.</p>

<p>St. Ambrose, passing from the bar to the bishopric
of Milan without being a deacon, and your Damasus,
whom a schism made bishop of Rome, profited by
this fatal success. They secured the destruction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the altar of Victory, which had been set up on the
Capitol<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> nearly eight hundred years before&mdash;a
monument of the courage of your ancestors, destined
to maintain their valour in their descendants. The
emblematic figure of Victory was no object of idolatry,
like your statues of Antony of Padua (who
“hears those whom God will not hear”), of Francis of
Assisi (who is represented over the door of a church
at Rheims with this inscription: “To Francis and
Jesus, both crucified”), of St. Crepin, St. Barbe,
and so many others; or like the blood of a score of
saints (headed by your patron Januarius, whom
the rest of the earth knows not) that is liquefied
at Naples on certain days, or the prepuce and navel
of Jesus, or the milk, and hair, and shift, and petticoat
of his mother. These are idolatries, as disgusting
as they are accredited. But this Victory,
surmounting a globe, with outspread wings, a sword
in hand, and head crowned with laurels, was merely
the noble device of the Roman Empire, the symbol
of virtue. Fanaticism robbed you of the pledge of
your glory.</p>

<p>With what effrontery did these new enthusiasts dare
to substitute their Rochs, and Fiacres, and Eustaces,
and Ursulas, and Scholasticas for Neptune, the
ruler of the seas; Mars, the god of war; and Juno,
the ruler of the air, under the sovereignty of the
great Zeus, the eternal Demiourgos, master of the
elements, the gods, and men! A thousand times
more idolatrous than your ancestors, these maniacs
bade you worship the bones of the dead. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
plagiarists of antiquity borrowed the lustral water
of the Romans and Greeks, their procession, the confession
that was made in the mysteries of Ceres
and Isis, their incense, libations, hymns, and the
very garments of their priests. They spoiled the
old religion, and clad themselves in its vesture.
Even to-day they bow down before the statues of
unknown men, while they heap reproaches on a
Pericles, a Solon, a Miltiades, a Cicero, a Scipio, or
a Cato for bending the knee before these emblems
of divinity.</p>

<p>Nay, is there a single episode in the Old or the
New Testament that has not been copied from the
ancient mythologies of India, Chaldæa, Egypt, and
Greece? Is not the sacrifice of Idomene the plain
source of that of Jephtha? Is not the roe of Iphigenia
the ram of Isaac? Do you not recognise
Eurydice in Edith, the wife of Lot? Minerva and
the winged horse Pegasus drew fountains from the
rocks when they struck them; the same prodigy is
ascribed to Moses. Bacchus had crossed the Red
Sea dry-shod before he did, and he had caused the
sun and moon to stand still before Joshua. We
have the same legends, the same extravagances, on
every side.</p>

<p>There is not a single miraculous action in the
gospels that you will not find in much earlier
writers. The goat Amalthæa had a horn of plenty
long before it was said that Jesus had fed five thousand
men, not to speak of the women, with two
fishes. The daughters of Anius had changed water
into wine and oil before there was any question of
the marriage-feast of Cana. Athalide, Hippolytus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Alcestis, Pelops, and Heres had returned to life
long before men spoke of the resurrection of Jesus;
and Romulus was born of a vestal virgin more than
seven hundred years before Jesus began to be regarded
as virgin-born. Compare, and judge for
yourselves.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ARTICLE IV.</h3>

<p>When your altar of Victory had been destroyed,
the barbarians came and finished the work of the
priests. Rome became the prey and the sport of
nations that it had so long ruled, if not repressed.</p>

<p>It is true that you still had consuls, a senate,
municipal laws; but the popes have robbed you of
what the Huns and Goths had left you.</p>

<p>It was in earlier times unheard of that a priest
should set up royal rights in any city of the Empire.
It is well known all over Europe, except in
your chancellery, that, until the time of Gregory VII.,
your pope was but a metropolitan bishop, subject
to the Greek, then the Frankish, emperors, and
then to the house of Saxony; receiving investiture
from them, compelled to send a profession of faith
to the bishops of Ravenna and Milan, as we read
expressly in your <cite>Diarium Romanum</cite>. His title
of “<ins class="corr" id="tn136" title="Transcriber’s Note—“patriach of the west” changed to “patriarch of the west”.">patriarch of the west</ins>”
gave him much prestige, but no sovereign rights. A priest-king was a
blasphemy in a religion of which the founder expressly says in the
gospels: “There shall be no first and last among you.” Weigh well,
Romans, these other words that are put in the mouth of Jesus: “To
sit on my right hand and on my left it is not mine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
to give, but for whom it is prepared of my father.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Know, moreover, that the Jews meant, and still
mean, by “son of God” a just man. Inquire of
the eight thousand Jews who sell old clothes, as
they ever have done, in your city, and pay close
attention to the following words: “Whosoever will
be great among you, let him be your minister. The
Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Do these clear and precise words mean that Boniface
VIII. was bound to crush the Colonna family;
that Alexander VI. was bound to poison so many
Roman barons; or that the bishop of Rome received
from God, in a time of anarchy, the duchy of Rome,
Ferrara, Bologna, the March of Ancona, Castro,
and Ronciglione, and all the country from Viterbo
to Terracina, which have been wrested from their
lawful owners? Think you, Romans, that Jesus was
sent on earth by God solely for the Rezzonico?</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ARTICLE V.</h3>

<p>You will ask me by what means this strange revolution
of all divine and human laws was brought
about. I am about to tell you; and I defy the most
zealous fanatic in whom there is still a spark of
reason, and the most determined rogue who has still
a trace of decency in his soul, to resist the force of
the truth, if he reads this important inquiry with
the attention it deserves.</p>

<p>It is certain and undoubted that the earliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
societies of the Galilæans, afterwards called Christians,
remained in obscurity, in the mud of the
cities; and it is certain that, when these Christians
began to write, they entrusted their books only to
those who had been initiated into their mysteries.
They were not even given to the catechumens, much
less to partisans of the imperial religion. No
Roman before the time of Trajan [98-117 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>]
knew that the gospels existed; no Greek or Latin
writer has ever quoted the word “gospel”; Plutarch,
Lucian, Petronius, and Apuleius, who speak
of everything, are entirely ignorant of the existence
of gospels. This proof, with a hundred others,
shows the absurdity of those authors who now hold,
or pretend to hold, that the disciples of Jesus died
for the truth of these gospels, of which the Romans
did not hear a word during two hundred years. The
half-Jew, half-Christian Galilæans, separated from
the disciples of John, and from the Therapeuts,
Essenians, Judaites, Herodians, Sadducees, and
Pharisees, recruited their little flock among the
lowest of the people, not, indeed, by means of books,
but of speech, by catechising the women and girls
(<cite>Acts</cite> xvi., 13 and 14) and children, and passing
from town to town; in a word, like all other sects.</p>

<p>Tell me frankly, Romans, what your ancestors
would have said if St. Paul, or Simon Barjona, or
Matthias, or Matthew, or Luke, had appeared in
the Senate and said: “Our God, Jesus, who passed
as the son of a carpenter during life, was born in
the year 752 from the foundation of Rome, under
the governorship of Cyrenius (<cite>Luke</cite> ii., 2), in a
Jewish village called Bethlehem, to which his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Joseph and his mother Mariah had gone to be included
in the census which Augustus had ordered.
This God was born in a stable, between an ox and
an ass.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The angels came down from heaven and
informed the peasants of his birth; a new star appeared
in the heavens, and led to him three kings
or wise men from the east, who brought him a
tribute of incense, myrrh, and gold; but in spite
of this gold he was poor throughout life. Herod,
who was then dying, and whom you had made king,
having learned that the new-born child was king
of the Jews, had fourteen thousand new-born infants
of the district put to death, to make sure that
the king was included (<cite>Matthew</cite> ii., 16). However,
one of our writers inspired by God says that
the God-king child fled to Egypt; and another
writer, equally inspired by God, says that the child
remained at Bethlehem (<cite>Luke</cite> ii., 39). One of
these sacred and infallible writers draws up a
royal genealogy for him; another composes for
him an entirely different royal genealogy. Jesus
preaches to the peasants, and turns water into wine
for them at a marriage feast. Jesus is taken by
the devil up into a mountain. He drives out devils,
and sends them into the body of two thousand pigs
in Galilee, where there never were any pigs. He
greatly insulted the magistrates, and the prætor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Pontius had him executed. When he had been executed,
he manifested his divinity. The earth trembled;
the dead left their graves, and walked about
in the city before the eyes of Pontius. There was
an eclipse of the sun at midday, at a time of full
moon, although that is impossible. He rose again
secretly, went up to heaven, and sent down another
god, who fell on the heads of his disciples in tongues
of fire. May these same tongues fall on your heads,
conscript fathers; become Christians.”</p>

<p>If the lowest official in the Senate had condescended
to answer this discourse, he would have
said: “You are weak-minded rogues, and ought to
be put in the asylum for the insane. You lie when
you say that your God was born in the year of
Rome 752, under the governorship of Cyrenius, the
proconsul of Syria. Cyrenius did not govern Syria
until more than ten years afterwards, as our
registers prove. Quintilius Varus was at that time
proconsul of Syria.</p>

<p>“You lie when you say that Augustus ordered
a census of ‘all the world.’ You must be very
ignorant not to know that Augustus was master
only of one tenth of the world. If by ‘all the
world’ you mean the Roman Empire, know that
neither Augustus nor anybody else ever undertook
such a census. Know that there was but one single
enumeration of the citizens of Rome and its territory
under Augustus, and that the number amounted to
four million citizens; and unless your carpenter Joseph
and his wife Mariah brought forth your God in
a suburb of Rome, and this Jewish carpenter was a
Roman citizen, he cannot possibly have been included.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p>“You are telling a ridiculous untruth with your
three kings and new star, and the little massacred
children, and the dead rising again and walking
in the streets under the eyes of Pontius Pilate,
who never wrote us a word about it, etc., etc.</p>

<p>“You are lying when you speak of an eclipse of
the sun at a time of full moon. Our prætor Pontius
Pilate would have written to us about it, and
we, together with all the nations of the earth, would
have witnessed this eclipse. Return to your work,
you fanatical peasants, and thank the Senate that
it has too much disdain to punish you.”</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ARTICLE VI.</h3>

<p>It is clear that the first half-Jewish Christians
took care not to address themselves to the Roman
Senators, nor to any man of position or any one
above the lowest level of the people. It is well
known that they appealed only to the lowest class.
To these they boasted of healing nervous diseases,
epilepsy, and uterine convulsions, which ignorant
folk, among the Romans as well as among the Jews,
Egyptians, Greeks, and Syrians, regarded as the
work of charms or diabolical possession. There
must assuredly have been some cases of healing.
Some were cured in the name of Esculapius, and
we have since discovered at Rome a monument of
a miracle of Esculapius, with the names of the witnesses.
Others were healed in the name of Isis,
or of the Syrian goddess; others in the name of
Jesus, etc. The common people healed in one of
these names believed in those who propagated it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ARTICLE VII.</h3>

<p>Thus the Christians made progress among the
people by a device that invariably seduces ignorant
folk. But they had a still more powerful means.
They declaimed against the rich. They preached
community of goods; in their secret meetings they
enjoined their neophytes to give them the little
money they had earned; and they quoted the alleged
instance of Sapphira and Ananias (<cite>Acts</cite> v., 1-11),
whom Simon Barjona, called Cephas, which means
Peter, caused to die suddenly because they had kept
a crown to themselves&mdash;the first and most detestable
example of priestly covetousness.</p>

<p>But they would not have succeeded in extorting the
money of their neophytes if they had not preached
the doctrine of the cynic philosophers&mdash;the idea of
voluntary poverty. Even this, however, was not
enough to form a new flock. The end of the world
had been long announced. You will find it in
Epicurus and Lucretius, his chief disciple. Ovid
had said, in the days of Augustus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">Esse quoque in fatis meminisceret adfore tempus,<br />
Quo mare, quo tellus, correptaque regio coeli<br />
Ardeat, et mundi moles operosa laboret.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>
</div>

<p>According to others, the world had been made by
a fortuitous concourse of atoms, and would be destroyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
by another fortuitous concourse, as we find
in the poems of Lucretius.</p>

<p>This idea came originally from the Brahmans of
India. Many Jews had adopted it by the time of
Herod. It is formally stated in the gospel of Luke,
as you have seen; it is in Paul’s epistles; and it is
in all those who are known as fathers of the Church.
The world was about to be destroyed, it was thought;
and the Christians announced a new Jerusalem,
which was seen in the air by night.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The Jews
talked of nothing but a new kingdom of heaven;
it was the system of John the Baptist, who had introduced
on the Jordan the ancient Hindoo practice
of baptism in the Ganges. Baptism was practised
by the Egyptians, and adopted by the Jews. This
new kingdom of heaven, to which the poor alone
would be admitted, was preached by Jesus and his
followers. They threatened with eternal torment
those who would not believe in the new heaven.
This hell, invented by the first Zoroaster, became
one of the chief points of Egyptian theology.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> From
the latter came the barque of Charon, Cerberus, the
river Lethe, Tartarus, and the Furies. From Egypt
the idea passed to Greece, and from there to the
Romans; the Jews were unacquainted with it until
the time when the Pharisees preached it, shortly
before the reign of Herod. It was one of their
contradictions to admit both hell and metempsychosis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
(transmigration of souls); but who would
look for reasoning among the Jews? Their powers
in that direction are confined to money matters.
The Sadducees and Samaritans rejected the immortality
of the soul, because it is not found anywhere
in the Mosaic law.</p>

<p>This was the great spring which the early Christians,
all half-Jewish, relied upon to put the new
machinery in action: community of goods, secret
meals, hidden mysteries, gospels read to the initiated
only, paradise for the poor, hell for the rich,
and exorcisms by charlatans. Here, in strict truth,
we have the first foundations of the Christian
sect. If I deceive you&mdash;or, rather, if I deliberately
deceive you&mdash;I pray the God of the universe, the
God of all men, to wither the hand that writes this,
to shatter with his lightning a head that is convinced
of the existence of a good and just God, and
to tear out from me a heart that worships him.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ARTICLE VIII.</h3>

<p>Let us now, Romans, consider the artifices,
roguery, and forgery to which the Christians themselves
have given the name of “pious frauds”;
frauds that have cost you your liberty and your
goods, and have brought down the conquerors of
Europe to a most lamentable slavery. I again take
God to witness that I will say no word that is
not amply proved. If I wished to use all the arms
of reason against fanaticism, all the piercing darts
of truth against error, I should speak to you first of
that prodigious number of contradictory gospels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
which your popes themselves now recognise to be
false. They show, at least, that there were forgers
among the first Christians. This, however, is very
well known. I have to tell you of impostures that
are not generally known, and are a thousand times
more pernicious.</p>


<h4><em>First Imposture</em></h4>

<p>It is a very ancient superstition that the last
words of the dying are prophetic, or are, at least,
sacred maxims and venerable precepts. It was believed
that the soul, about to dissolve the union
with the body and already half united to the Deity,
had a cloudless vision of the future and of truth.
Following this prejudice, the Judæo-Christians
forge, in the first century of the Church, the <cite>Testament
of the Twelve Patriarchs</cite>, written in Greek,
to serve as a prediction or a preparation for the
new kingdom of Jesus. In the testament of Reuben
we find these words: “Adore his seed, for he will
die for you, in wars visible and invisible, and he will
be your king for ever.” This prophecy is applied
to Jesus, in the usual way of those who wrote fifty-four
gospels in various places, and who nearly all
endeavoured to find in Jewish writers, especially
those who were called prophets, passages that could
be twisted in favour of Jesus. They even added
some that are clearly recognised as false. The
author of the <cite>Testament of the Patriarchs</cite> is one
of the most impudent and clumsy forgers that ever
spoiled good parchment. His book was written in
Alexandria, in the school of a certain Mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>


<h4><em>Second Chief Imposture</em></h4>

<p>They forged letters from the king of Edessa to
Jesus, and from Jesus to this supposed prince.
There was no king at Edessa, which was a town
under the Syrian governor; the petty prince of
Edessa never had the title of king. Moreover, it
is not said in any of the gospels that Jesus could
write; and if he could, he would have left some
proof of it to his disciples. Hence these letters are
now declared by all scholars to be forgeries.</p>


<h4><em>Third Chief Imposture</em></h4>

<p class="pfs80 p0">(<em>which contains several</em>)</p>

<p>They forged <cite>Acts of Pilate</cite>, letters of Pilate, and
even a history of Pilate’s wife. The letters of
Pilate are especially interesting. Here is a fragment
of one:</p>

<p>“It happened a short time ago, and I have verified
it, that the Jews in their envy drew on themselves
a cruel condemnation. Their God having
promised that he would send his holy one to them
from heaven to be their legitimate king, and that
he should be born of a virgin, did indeed send him
when I was procurator in Judæa. The leaders of
the Jews denounced him to me as a magician. I
believed it, and had him scourged, and handed him
over to them; and they crucified him. They put
guards about his tomb, but he rose again the third
day.”</p>

<p>To this forgery I may add that of the rescript of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Tiberius to the Senate, to raise Jesus to the rank
of the imperial gods, and the ridiculous letters of
the philosopher Seneca to Paul, and of Paul to
Seneca, written in barbaric Latin; also the letters
of the Virgin Mary to St. Ignatius, and many other
clumsy fictions of the same nature. I will not draw
out this list of impostures. It would amaze you
if I enumerated them one by one.</p>


<h4><em>Fourth Imposture</em></h4>

<p>The boldest, perhaps, and clumsiest of these
forgeries is that of the prophecies attributed to the
Sibyls, foretelling the incarnation, miracles, and
death of Jesus, in acrostic verse. This piece of
folly, unknown to the Romans, fed the belief of the
catechumens. It circulated among us for eight centuries,
and we still sing in one of our hymns<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
“teste David cum Sibylla” [witness David and the
Sibyl].</p>

<p>You are astonished, no doubt, that this despicable
comedy was maintained so long, and that men could
be led with such a bridle as that. But as the
Christians were plunged in the most stupid barbarism
for fifteen hundred years, as books were very
rare and theologians very astute, one could say
anything at all to poor wretches who would believe
anything at all.</p>


<h4><em>Fifth Imposture</em></h4>

<p>Illustrious and unfortunate Romans, before we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
come to the pernicious untruths which have cost
you your liberty, your property, and your glory,
and put you under the yoke of a priest; before I
speak to you of the alleged pontificate of Simon
Barjona, who is said to have been bishop of Rome
for twenty-five years, you must be informed of the
“Apostolic Constitutions,” the first foundation of
the hierarchy that crushes you to-day.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second century there was
no such thing as an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">episcopos</i> (“overseer”) or
bishop, clothed with real dignity for life, unalterably
attached to a certain see, and distinguished
from other men by his clothes; bishops, in fact,
dressed like ordinary laymen until the middle of
the fifth century. The meeting was held in a
chamber of some retired house. The minister was
chosen by the initiated, and continued his work as
long as they were satisfied. There were no altars,
candles, or incense; the earliest fathers of the
Church speak of altars and temples with a shudder.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
They were content to make a collection and sup
together. When the Christian society had grown,
however, ambition set up an hierarchy. How did
they go about it? The rogues who led the enthusiasts
made them believe that they had discovered
the apostolic constitutions written by St. John and
St. Matthew: “quæ ego Matthæus et Joannes vobis
tradidimus [which I, Matthew, and John have given
you].”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In these Matthew is supposed to say (II.,
xxxvi.): “Be ye careful not to judge your bishop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
for it is given to the priests alone to judge.” Matthew
and John say (II., xxxiv.): “As much as the
soul is above the body, so much higher is the priesthood
than royalty; consider your bishop as a king,
an absolute master (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominum</i>); give him your
fruits, your works, your firstlings, your tithes, your
savings, the first and tenth part of your wine, oil,
and corn, etc.” Again (II., xxx.): “Let the
bishop be a god to you, and the deacon a prophet”;
and (II., xxxviii.): “In the festivals let the deacon
have a double portion, and the priest double that of
the deacon; and if they be not at table, send the
portions to them.”</p>

<p>You see, Romans, the origin of your custom of
spreading your tables to give indigestion to your
pontiffs. Would to God they had confined themselves
to the sin of gluttony.</p>

<p>You will further observe with care, in regard to
this imposture of the constitutions of the apostles,
that it is an authentic monument of the dogmas of
the second century, and that forgery at least does
homage to truth in maintaining a complete silence
about innovations that could not be foreseen&mdash;innovations
with which you have been deluged century
after century. You will find, in this second-century
document, neither trinity, nor consubstantiality,
nor transubstantiation, nor auricular confession.
You will not find in it that the mother of Jesus
was the mother of God, that Jesus had two
natures and two wills, or that the Holy Ghost
proceeds from the father and the son. All these
singular ornaments of imagination, unknown to the
religion of the gospels, have been added since to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
the crude structure which fanaticism and ignorance
raised up in the first centuries.</p>

<p>You will assuredly find in it three persons, but
not three persons in one God. Read with all the
acuteness of your mind, the only treasure that your
tyrants have left you, the common prayer which
the Christians, by the mouth of their bishop, offered
in their meetings in the second century:</p>

<p>“O all-powerful, unengendered, inaccessible God,
the one true God, father of Christ thy only son, God
of the paraclete, God of all, thou hast made the
disciples of Christ doctors, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Here, clearly, is one sole God who commands Christ
and the paraclete [Holy Ghost]. Judge for yourselves
if that has any resemblance to the trinity
and consubstantiality which were afterwards declared
at Nicæa, in spite of the strong protest of
eighteen bishops and two thousand priests.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In another place (III., xvi.) the author of the
<cite>Apostolic Constitutions</cite>, who is probably a bishop
of the Christians at Rome, says expressly that the
father is God above all.</p>

<p>That is the doctrine of Paul, finding expression
so frequently in his epistles. “We have peace in
God through Our Lord Jesus Christ” (<cite>Romans</cite> v.,
1). “If through the offence of one many be dead,
much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace,
which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded
unto many” (<cite>Romans</cite> v., 15). “We are heirs of
God, and joint-heirs with Christ” (<cite>Romans</cite> viii., 17).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
“Receive ye one another, as Christ also received
us to the glory of God” (<cite>Romans</cite> xv., 7). “To
God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for
ever” (<cite>Romans</cite> xvi., 27). “That the God of Our
Lord Jesus Christ, the father of glory, may give
unto you the spirit of wisdom” (<cite>Ephesians</cite> i.,
17).</p>

<p>Thus does the Jew-Christian Saul Paul always
express himself, and thus is Jesus himself made
to speak in the gospels. “My Father is greater than
I” (<cite>John</cite> xiv., 28); that is to say, God can do
what men cannot do. All the Jews said “my
father” when they spoke of God.</p>

<p>The Lord’s Prayer begins with the words “Our
Father.” Jesus said: “Of that day and hour
knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but
my Father only” (<cite>Matthew</cite> xxiv., 36); and “That
is not mine to give, but for whom it is prepared
by my Father” (<cite>Matthew</cite> xx., 23). It is
also very remarkable that when Jesus awaited
arrest, and sweated blood and water, he cried
out: “Father, remove this cup from me” (<cite>Luke</cite>
xxii., 42). No gospel has put into his mouth the
blasphemy that he was God, or consubstantial with
God.</p>

<p>You will ask me, Romans, why and how he was
made into a God in the course of time? I will
ask you in turn why and how Bacchus, Perseus,
Hercules, and Romulus were made gods? In their
case, moreover, the sacrilege did not go so far as
to give them the title of supreme god and creator.
This blasphemy was reserved for the Christian
outgrowth of the Jewish sect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>


<h4><em>Sixth Chief Imposture</em></h4>

<p>I pass over the countless impostures of “The
Travels of Simon Barjona,” the “Gospel of Simon
Barjona,” his “Apocalypse,” the “Apocalypse” of
Cerinthus (ridiculously attributed to John), the
epistles of Barnaby, the “Gospel of the Twelve
Apostles,” their liturgies, the “Canons of the Council
of the Apostles,” the “Apostles’ Creed,” the
“Travels of Matthew,” the “Travels of Thomas,”
and so many other vagaries that are now recognised
to be the work of forgers, who passed them off under
venerated Christian names.</p>

<p>I will not insist much on the romance of the
alleged Pope St. Clement, who calls himself the first
successor of St. Peter. I will note only that Simon
Barjona and he met an old man, who complained
of the unfaithfulness of his wife, who had lain with
his servant. Clement asks how he learned it. “By
my wife’s horoscope,” said the good man, “and
from my brother, with whom she wished to lie, but
he would not.” From these words Clement recognised
his father in the old man.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> From Peter Clement
learned that he was of the blood of the Cæsars.
On such romances, Romans, was the papal power
set up!</p>


<h4><em>Seventh Chief Imposture</em></h4>

<p class="pfs80 p0"><em>On the Supposed Pontificate of Simon Barjona,
Called Peter</em></p>

<p>Who was the first to say that Simon, the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
fisherman, came from Galilee to Rome, spoke Latin
there (though he could not possibly know more
than his native dialect), and in the end was pope
of Rome for twenty-five years? It was a Syrian
named Abdias, who lived about the end of the first
century, and is said to have been bishop of Babylon
(a good bishopric). He wrote in Syriac, and we
have his work in a Latin translation by Julius the
African. Listen well to what this intelligent writer
says. He was an eye-witness, and his testimony is
irrefragable.</p>

<p>Simon Barjona Peter, having, he says, raised to
life Tabitha, or Dorcas, the sempstress of the apostles,
and having been put in prison by the orders
of King Herod (though there was no King Herod
at the time); and an angel having opened the doors
of the prison for him (after the custom of angels),
met, in Cæsarea, the other Simon, of Samaria, known
as the Magician (Magus), who also performed miracles.
They began to defy each other. Simon the
Samaritan went off to the Emperor Nero at Rome.
Simon Barjona followed him, and the emperor received
them excellently. A cousin of the emperor
had died, and it was a question which of them could
restore him to life. The Samaritan has the honour
of opening the ceremony. He calls upon God, and
the dead man gives signs of life and shakes his
head. Simon Peter calls on Jesus Christ, and tells
the dead man to rise; forthwith he does rise, and
embraces Peter. Then follows the well-known story
of the two dogs. Then Abdias tells how Simon
flew in the air, and his rival Simon Peter brought
him down. Simon the Magician broke his legs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Nero had Simon Peter crucified, head downwards,
for breaking the legs of the other Simon.</p>

<p>This harlequinade was described, not only by
Abdias, but by some one named Marcellus, and by
a certain Hegesippus, whom Eusebius often quotes
in his history. Pray notice, judicious Romans, how
this Simon Peter may have reigned spiritually in
your city for twenty-five years. He came to it
under Nero, according to the earliest writers of the
Church; he died under Nero; and Nero reigned only
thirteen years.</p>

<p>Read the <cite>Acts of the Apostles</cite>. Is there any
question therein of Peter going to Rome? Not the
least mention. Do you not see that, when the fiction
began that Peter was the first of the apostles,
it was thought that the imperial city alone was
worthy of him? See how clumsily you have been
deluded in everything. Is it possible that the son
of God, nay God himself, should have made use
of a play on words, a ridiculous pun, to make Simon
Barjona the head of his Church: “Thou art Peter,
and upon this rock [petra] I will build my Church.”
Had Barjona been called Pumpkin, Jesus might
have said to him: “Thou art Pumpkin, and Pumpkin
shall henceforward be the king of the fruits
in my garden.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>For more than three hundred years the alleged successor
of a Galilean peasant was unknown to Rome.
Let us now see how the popes became your masters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>


<h4><em>Eighth Imposture</em></h4>

<p>No one who is acquainted with the history of the
Greek and Latin Churches can be unaware that the
metropolitan sees established their chief rights at
the Council of Chalcedon, convoked in the year 451
by the order of the Emperor Marcian and of Pulcheria
[his wife], and composed of six hundred and
thirty bishops. The senators who presided in the
emperor’s name had on their right the patriarchs
of Alexandria and Jerusalem, on their left the
patriarch of Constantinople and the deputies of the
patriarch of Rome. It was in virtue of the canons
of this Council that the episcopal sees shared the
dignities of the cities in which they were situated.
The bishops of the two imperial cities, Rome and
Constantinople, were declared to be the first bishops,
with equal prerogatives, by the celebrated twenty-eighth
canon:</p>

<p>“The fathers have justly granted prerogatives to
the see of ancient Rome, as to a reigning city, and
the 150 bishops of the first Council of Constantinople,
very dear to God, have for the same reason
given the same privileges to the new Rome; they
have rightly thought that this city, in which the
Emperor and Senate reside, should be equal to it
in all ecclesiastical matters.”</p>

<p>The popes have always contested the authenticity
of this canon; they have twisted and perverted its
whole meaning. What did they do at length to
evade this equality and gradually to destroy all
the titles of subjection which placed them under
the emperors like all other men? They forged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
famous donation of Constantine, which has been
for many centuries so strictly regarded as genuine
that it was a mortal and unpardonable
sin to doubt it, and whoever did so incurred
the greater excommunication by the very fact of
doubting.</p>

<p>A very pretty thing was this donation of Constantine
to Bishop Sylvester.</p>

<p>“We,” says the Emperor, “with all our satraps
and the whole Roman people, have thought it good
to give to the successors of St. Peter a greater
power than that of our serene majesty.” Do you
not think, Romans, that the word “satrap” comes
in very well there?</p>

<p>With equal authenticity, Constantine goes on, in
this noble diploma, to say that he has put the
Apostles Peter and Paul in large amber caskets;
that he has built the churches of St. Peter and
St. Paul; that he has given them vast domains in
Judæa, Greece, Thrace, Asia, etc. (to maintain the
luminary); that he has given to the pope his
Lateran palace, with chamberlains and guards; and
that, lastly, he gives him, as a pure donation for
himself and his successors, the city of Rome, Italy,
and all the western provinces; and all this is given
to thank the Pope Sylvester for having cured him
of leprosy, and having baptised him&mdash;though, in
point of fact, he was baptised only on his death-bed,
by Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia.</p>

<p>Never was there a document more ridiculous from
one end to the other, yet more accredited in the
ignorant ages in which Europe was so long detained
after the fall of your empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>


<h4><em>Ninth Imposture</em></h4>

<p>I pass over the thousand and one little daily
impostures to come at once to the great fraud of
the Decretals.</p>

<p>These false Decretals were spread everywhere in
the time of Charlemagne. In these, Romans, the
better to rob you of your liberty, the bishops are
deprived of theirs; it is decreed that the bishop of
Rome shall be their only judge. Certainly, if he is
the sovereign of the bishops, he should soon be
yours; and that is what happened. These false
Decretals abolished the Councils, and even abolished
your Senate, which became merely a court of justice,
subject to the will of a priest. Here is the real
source of the humiliation you have suffered. Your
rights and privileges, so long maintained by your
wisdom, could be wrested from you only by untruth.
Only by lying to God and men did they
succeed in making slaves of you; but they have
never extinguished the love of liberty in your hearts.
The greater the tyranny, the greater is that love.
The sacred name of liberty is still heard in your
conversations and gatherings, and in the very antechamber
of the pope.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">ARTICLE IX.</h3>

<p>Cæsar was but your dictator; Augustus was content
to be your general, consul, and tribune; Tiberius,
Caligula, and Nero left you your elections,
your prerogatives, and your dignities; even the
barbarians respected them. You maintained your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
municipal government. Not by the authority of
your bishop, Gregory III., but of your own decision,
you offered the dignity of patrician to the great
Charles Martel, master of his king, conqueror of the
Saracens in the year 741 of our faulty vulgar era.</p>

<p>Believe not that it was the Bishop Leo III. who
made Charlemagne emperor; it is an absurd romance
of the secretary Eginhard, a vile flatterer of the
popes, who had won him. By what right and in
what way could a subject bishop make an emperor?
Emperors were created only by the people, or by the
armies that took the place of the people.</p>

<p>It was you, people of Rome, who used your rights;
you who would no longer depend on a Greek emperor,
who gave you no aid; you who appointed
Charlemagne, or he would have been a usurper. The
annalists of the time agree that all was arranged
by Carolo and your leading officers, as is, indeed,
most probable. Your bishop’s only share in it was
to conduct an empty ceremony and receive rich
presents. The only authority he had in your city
was that of the prestige attaching to his mitre, his
clergy, and his ability.</p>

<p>But while you gave yourselves to Charlemagne,
you retained the election of your officers. The
police was in your hands; you kept possession of
the mole of Adrian, so absurdly called in later times
the Castello Sant’ Angelo; and you were not wholly
enslaved until your bishops seized that fortress.</p>

<p>They made their way step by step to that supreme
greatness, so expressly forbidden them by him whom
they call their God, and of whom they dare to call
themselves the vicars. They had never any jurisdiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
in Rome under the Othos. Excommunication
and intrigue were their sole arms; and even
when, in an age of anarchy, they became the real
sovereigns, they never dared to assume the title. I
defy the astutest of those fabricators of titles who
abound in your court to find a single one in which
the pope is described as prince by the grace of
God. A strange princedom, when one fears to
avow it!</p>

<p>The imperial cities of Germany, which have
bishops, are free; and you, Romans, are not. The
archbishop of Cologne has not even the right to
sleep in that city; and your pope will hardly allow
you to sleep in your own. The sultan of the Turks
is far less despotic at Constantinople than the pope
has become at Rome.</p>

<p>You perish miserably in the shade of superb colonnades.
Your noble and faded paintings, and your
dozen gems of ancient sculpture, bring you neither
a good dinner nor a good bed. The opulence is for
your masters: the indigence is for you. The lot of
a slave among the ancient Romans was a hundred
times better than yours. <em>He</em> might acquire a large
fortune; <em>you</em> are born serfs, you die serfs, and the
only oil you have is that of the Last Anointing.
Slaves in body and in soul, your tyrants do not
even allow you to read, in your own tongue, the
book on which they say your religion is founded.</p>

<p>Awake, Romans, at the call of liberty, truth, and
nature. The cry rings over Europe. You must
hear it. Break the chains that bind your generous
hands&mdash;the chains forged by tyranny in the den of
imposture.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SERMON_OF_THE_FIFTY">THE SERMON OF THE FIFTY</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fifty</span> cultivated, pious, and reasonable persons
have, for a year past, met every Sunday in a large
commercial town. They have prayers, and then a
member of the society gives a discourse. They
afterwards dine, and a collection for the poor is
made after dinner. Each presides in turn, and it
is the duty of the president to offer the prayer and
give the sermon. Here are one of the prayers and
one of the sermons.</p>

<p>If the seed of these words fall on good soil, it
will assuredly bear fruit.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">PRAYER</h3>

<p>God of all the globes and stars, the one prayer
that it is meet to offer to you is submission. How
can we ask anything of him who arranged and
enchained all things from the beginning? Yet if
it is permitted to expose our needs to a father, preserve
in our hearts this feeling of submission and
a pure religion. Keep from us all superstition.
Since there are those who insult you with unworthy
sacrifices, abolish those infamous mysteries. Since
there are those who dishonour the divinity with
absurd fables, may those fables perish for ever. If
the days of the prince and the magistrate were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
numbered from all eternity, give them length of
days. Preserve the purity of our ways, the friendship
of our brethren for each other, their goodwill
towards all men, their obedience to the laws, and
their wisdom in private life. Let them live and
die in the worship of one God, the rewarder of
good, the punisher of evil; a God that could not be
born or die, nor have associates, but who has too
many rebellious children in this world.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">SERMON</h3>

<p>My brethren, religion is the secret voice of God
speaking to men. It ought to unite men, not divide
them; hence every religion that belongs to one people
only is false. Ours is, in principle, that of the
whole universe; for we worship a supreme being as
all nations do, we practise the justice which all
nations teach, and we reject all the untruths with
which the nations reproach each other. At one with
them in the principle which unites them, we differ
from them in the things about which they are in
conflict.</p>

<p>The point on which all men of all times agree
must be the centre of truth, and the points on
which they all differ must be standards of falsehood.
Religion must conform to morality, and, like
it, be universal; hence every religion whose dogmas
offend against morality is certainly false. It is
under this twofold aspect of perversity and falseness
that we will, in this discourse, examine the
books of the Hebrews and of those who have succeeded
them. Let us first see if these books conform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
to morality; we shall then see if they have
any shade of probability. The first two points
will deal with the Old Testament; the third will
discuss the New.</p>


<h4><em>First Point</em></h4>

<p>You know, my brethren, what horror fell on us
when we read together the writings of the Hebrews,
confining our attention to those features which
offend against purity, charity, good faith, justice,
and reason&mdash;features which one not only finds in
every chapter, but, unhappily, one finds consecrated
in them.</p>

<p>First, to say nothing of the extravagant injustice
which they venture to ascribe to the supreme being,
in endowing a serpent with speech in order to
seduce a woman and her innocent posterity, let us
run over in succession all the historical horrors
which outrage nature and good sense. One of the
patriarchs, Lot, the nephew of Abraham, receives in
his house two angels disguised as pilgrims; the inhabitants
of Sodom entertain impure desires of these
angels; Lot, who had two daughters promised in
marriage, offers to abandon them to the people instead
of the two strangers. These young women
must have been strangely familiar with evil ways,
since the first thing they do after the destruction
of their town by a rain of fire, and after their
mother has been changed into a pillar of salt, is
to intoxicate their father on two consecutive nights,
in order to sleep with him in succession. It is an
imitation of the ancient Arabic legend of Cyniras<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and Myrrha. But in this more decent legend
Myrrha is punished for her crime, while the
daughters of Lot are rewarded with what is, in
Jewish eyes, the greatest and dearest blessing: they
become the mothers of a numerous posterity.</p>

<p>We will not insist on the falsehood of Isaac, the
father of the just, who says that his wife is his
sister; whether he was merely repeating the falsehood
of Abraham, or Abraham was really guilty of
taking his sister to wife. But let us dwell for a
moment on the patriarch Jacob, who is offered to us
as a model man. He compels his brother, who is
dying of hunger, to give up his birthright for a
dish of lentils. He afterwards deceives his aged
father on his death-bed. After deceiving his father,
he deceives and robs his father-in-law Laban. Not
content with wedding two sisters, he lies with all
his servants; and God blesses this licentiousness
and trickery. Who are the children of such a
father? His daughter Dinah pleases a prince of
Sichem, and it is probable that she loves the prince,
since she lies with him. The prince asks her in
marriage, and she is promised on condition that he
and all his people are circumcised. The prince accepts
the condition; but as soon as he and his people
undergo this painful operation&mdash;which, nevertheless,
leaves them strong enough to defend themselves&mdash;Jacob’s
family murder all the men of Sichem and
enslave their women and children.</p>

<p>We have in our infancy heard the story of Pelopæus.
This incestuous abomination is repeated in
Judah, the patriarch and father of the first tribe.
He lies with his daughter-in-law, and then wishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
to have her killed. The book declares that then
Joseph, a child of this vagabond family, is sold into
Egypt, and that, foreigner as he is, he is made first
minister as a reward for explaining a dream. What
a first minister he was, compelling a whole nation
to enslave itself, during a time of famine, to obtain
food! What magistrate among us would, in time
of famine, dare to propose so abominable a bargain,
and what nation would accept it? Let us not
stay to examine how seventy members of the family
of Joseph, who settled in Egypt, could in two hundred
and fifteen years increase to six hundred thousand
fighting men, without counting the women, old
men, and children, which would make a total of
more than two millions. Let us not discuss how it
is that the text has four hundred and thirty years,
when the same text has given two hundred and
fifteen. The infinite number of contradictions,
which are the seal of imposture, is not the point
which we are considering. Let us likewise pass
over the ridiculous prodigies of Moses and of
Pharaoh’s magicians, and all the miracles wrought
to give the Jewish people a wretched bit of poor
country, which they afterwards purchase by blood
and crime, instead of giving them the fertile soil
of Egypt, where they were. Let us confine ourselves
to the frightful iniquity of their ways.</p>

<p>Their God had made a thief of Jacob, and he now
makes thieves of the entire people. He orders his
people to steal and take away with them all the
gold and silver vessels and utensils of the Egyptians.
Behold these wretches, to the number of six
hundred thousand fighting men, instead of taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
up arms like men of spirit, flying like brigands led
by their God. If their God had wished to give them
a good country, he might have given them Egypt.
He does not, however; he leads them into a desert.
They might have fled by the shortest route, yet they
go far out of their way to cross the Red Sea dry-foot.
After this fine miracle Moses’ own brother
makes them another god, and this god is a calf. To
punish his brother Moses commands certain priests
to kill their sons, brothers, and fathers; and they
kill twenty-three thousand Jews, who let themselves
be slain like cattle.</p>

<p>After this butchery it is not surprising to hear
that this abominable people sacrifices human victims
to its god, whom it calls Adonai, borrowing
the name of Adonis from the Phœnicians. The
twenty-ninth verse of chapter xxvii. of <cite>Leviticus</cite>
expressly forbids the redemption of those who are
destined for sacrifice, and it is in virtue of this
cannibalistic law that Jephthah, some time afterwards,
offers up his own daughter.</p>

<p>It was not enough to slay twenty-three thousand
men for a calf; we have again twenty-four thousand
sacrificed for having intercourse with idolatrous
women. It is, my brethren, a worthy prelude and
example of persecution on the ground of religion.</p>

<p>This people advances in the deserts and rocks of
Palestine. Here is your splendid country, God says
to them. Slay all the inhabitants, kill all the male
infants, make an end of their married women, keep
the young girls for yourselves. All this is carried
out to the letter, according to the Hebrew books;
and we should shudder at the account, if the text<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
did not add that the Jews found in the camp of
the Midianites 675,000 sheep, 62,000 cattle, 61,000
asses, and 32,000 girls. Happily, the absurdity undoes
the barbarism. Once more, however, I am not
concerned here with what is ridiculous and impossible;
I select only what is execrable. Having
passed the Jordan dry-shod, as they crossed the sea,
we find our people in the promised land.</p>

<p>The first person to let in this holy people, by an
act of treachery, is Rahab, a strange character for
God to associate with himself. He levels the walls
of Jericho at the sound of the trumpet; the holy
people enters the town&mdash;to which it had no right,
on its own confession&mdash;and slays the men, women,
and children. Let us pass over the other carnages,
the crucifixion of kings, the supposed wars
against the giants of Gaza and Ascalon, and the
murder of those who could not pronounce the word
“Shibboleth.”</p>

<p>Listen to this fine story.</p>

<p>A Levite, with his wife, arrives on his ass at
Gibeah, in the tribe of Benjamin. Some of the
Benjamites, who are bent on committing the sin
of sodomy with the Levite, turn their brutality
upon the woman, who dies of the violence. Were
the culprits punished? Not at all. The eleven
tribes slaughtered the whole tribe of Benjamin; only
six hundred men escaped. But the eleven tribes
are afterwards sorry to see a tribe perish, and, to
restore it, they exterminate the inhabitants of one of
their own towns in order to take from it six hundred
girls, whom they give to the six hundred Benjamites
who survive to perpetuate this splendid race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>

<p>How many crimes committed in the name of the
Lord! We will give only that of the man of God
(Ehud). The Jews, having come so far to conquer,
are subject to the Philistines. In spite of the Lord,
they have sworn obedience to King Eglon. A holy
Jew, named Ehud, asks permission to speak in private
with the king on the part of God. The king
does not fail to grant the audience. Ehud assassinates
him, and his example has been used many
times by Christians to betray, destroy, or massacre
so many sovereigns.</p>

<p>At length this chosen nation, which had thus been
directed by God himself, desires to have a king;
which greatly displeases the priest Samuel. The
first Jewish king renews the custom of immolating
men. Saul prudently enjoined that his soldiers
should not eat on the day they fought the Philistines,
to give them more vigour; he swore to the
Lord that he would immolate to him any man who
ate. Happily, the people were wiser than he; they
would not suffer the king’s son to be sacrificed for
eating a little honey. But listen, my brethren, to
this most detestable, yet most consecrated, act. It
is said that Saul takes prisoner a king of the country,
named Agag. He did not kill his prisoner; he
acted as is usual in humane and civilised nations.
What happened? The Lord is angry, and Samuel,
priest of the Lord, says to Saul: “You are reprobate
for having spared a king who surrendered to
you.” And the priestly butcher at once cuts Agag
into pieces. What would you say, my brethren, if,
when the Emperor Charles V. had a French king in
his hands, his chaplain came and said to him: “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
are damned for not killing Francis I.,” and proceeded
to cut the French king to pieces before the
eyes of the emperor?</p>

<p>What will you say of the holy King David, the
king who found favour in the eyes of the God of
the Jews, and merited to be an ancestor of the
Messiah? This good king is at first a brigand,
capturing and pillaging all he finds. Among
others, he despoils a rich man named Nabal,
marries his wife, and flies to King Achish. During
the night he descends upon the villages of King
Achish, his benefactor, with fire and sword. He
slaughters men, women, and children, says the
sacred text, lest there be any one left to take the
news. When he is made king he ravishes the wife
of Uriah, and has the husband put to death; and it
is from this adulterous homicide that the Messiah&mdash;God
himself&mdash;descends. What blasphemy! This
David, who thus becomes an ancestor of God as a
reward of his horrible crime, is punished for the
one good and wise action which he did. There is no
good and prudent prince who ought not to know
the number of his people, as the shepherd should
know the number of his flock. David has them
enumerated&mdash;though we are not told what the number
was&mdash;and for making this wise and useful enumeration
a prophet comes from God to give him
the choice of war, pestilence, or famine.</p>

<p>Let us not linger, my dear brethren, over the numberless
barbarities of the kings of Judah and Israel&mdash;their
murders and outrages, mixed up always with
ridiculous stories; though even the ridiculous in
them is always bloody, and not even the prophet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
Elisha is free from barbarism. This worthy devotee
has forty children devoured by bears because the
innocent youngsters had called him “bald.” Let
us leave this atrocious nation in the Babylonian captivity
and in its bondage to the Romans, with all
the fine promises of their god Adonis or Adonai,
who had so often promised the Jews the sovereignty
of the earth. In fine, under the wise government
of the Romans, a king is born to the Hebrews. You
know, my brethren, who this king, <em>shilo</em>, or Messiah
is; it is he who, after being at first numbered among
the prophets without a mission, who, though not
priests, made a profession of inspiration, was, after
some centuries, regarded as a god. We need go no
farther; let us see on what pretexts, what facts,
what miracles, what prophecies&mdash;in a word, on what
foundation, this disgusting and abominable history
is based.</p>


<h4><em>Second Point</em></h4>

<p>O God, if thou thyself didst descend upon the
earth, and didst command me to believe this tissue
of murders, thefts, assassinations, and incests committed
by thy order and in thy name, I should say
to thee: No; thy sanctity cannot ask me to acquiesce
in these horrible things that outrage thee. Thou
seekest, no doubt, to try me.</p>

<p>How, then, my virtuous and enlightened hearers,
could we accept this frightful story on the wretched
evidence which is offered in support of it?</p>

<p>Run briefly over the books that have been falsely
attributed to Moses. I say falsely, since it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
possible for Moses to have written about things
that happened long after his time. None of us
would believe that the memoirs of William, Prince
of Orange, were written with his own hand if there
were allusions in these memoirs to things that happened
after his death. Let us see what is narrated
in the name of Moses. First, God created the light,
which he calls “day”; then the darkness, which
he calls “night,” and it was the first day. Thus
there were days before the sun was made.</p>

<p>On the sixth day God makes man and woman;
but the author, forgetting that woman has been
made already, afterwards derives her from one of
Adam’s ribs. Adam and Eve are put in a garden
from which four rivers issue; and of these rivers
there are two, the Euphrates and the Nile, which
have their sources a thousand miles from each other.
The serpent then spoke like a man; it was the most
cunning of animals. It persuades the woman to
eat an apple, and so has her driven from paradise.
The human race increases, and the children of God
fall in love with the daughters of men. There were
giants on the earth, and God was sorry that he had
made man. He determined to exterminate him by
a flood; but wished to save Noah, and ordered him
to make a vessel of poplar wood, three hundred
cubits in length. Into this vessel were to be brought
seven pairs of all the clean animals, and two pairs
of the unclean. It was necessary to feed them during
the ten months that the water covered the earth.
You can imagine what would be needed to feed
fourteen elephants, fourteen camels, fourteen buffaloes,
and as many horses, asses, deer, serpents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
ostriches&mdash;in a word, more than two thousand
species.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> You will ask me whence came the water
to cover the whole earth and rise fifteen cubits
above the highest mountains? The text replies that
it came from the cataracts of heaven. Heaven
knows where these cataracts are. After the deluge
God enters into an alliance with Noah and with all
the animals; and in confirmation of this alliance he
institutes the rainbow.</p>

<p>Those who wrote these things were not, as you
perceive, great physicists. However, here is Noah
with a religion given to him by God, and this
religion is neither Jewish nor Christian. The posterity
of Noah seeks to build a tower that shall
reach to heaven. A fine enterprise! But God fears
it, and causes the workers suddenly to speak several
different tongues, and they disperse. The whole is
written in this ancient oriental vein.</p>

<p>A rain of fire converts towns into a lake; Lot’s
wife is changed into a salt statue; Jacob fights all
night with an angel, and is hurt in the leg; Joseph,
sold as a slave into Egypt, is made first minister
because he explains a dream. Seventy members of
the family settle in Egypt, and in two hundred and
fifteen years, as we saw, multiply into two millions.
It is these two million Hebrews who fly from Egypt,
and go the longest way in order to have the pleasure
of crossing the sea dry-shod.</p>

<p>But there is nothing surprising about this
miracle. Pharaoh’s magicians performed some very
fine miracles. Like Moses, they changed a rod into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
a serpent, which is a very simple matter. When
Moses changed water into blood, they did the same.
When he brought frogs into existence, they imitated
him. But they were beaten when it came to the
plague of lice; on that subject the Jews knew more
than other nations.</p>

<p>In the end Adonai causes the death of each first-born
in Egypt in order to allow his people to leave
in peace. The sea divides to let them pass; it was
the least that could be done on such an occasion.
The remainer is on the same level. The people
cry out in the desert. Some of the husbands complain
of their wives; at once a water is found which
causes any woman who has forfeited her honour to
swell and burst. They have neither bread nor
paste; quails and manna are rained on them. Their
garments last forty years, and grow with the
children. Apparently clothes descend from heaven
for the new-born children.</p>

<p>A prophet of the district seeks to curse the people,
but his ass opposes the project, together with an
angel, and the ass speaks very reasonably and at
great length to the prophet.</p>

<p>When they attack a town, the walls fall at the
sound of trumpets; just as Amphion built walls to
the sound of the flute. But the finest miracle is
when five Amorite kings&mdash;that is to say, five village
sheiks&mdash;attempt to oppose the ravages of
Joshua. They are not merely vanquished and cut
to pieces, but the Lord sends a great rain of stones
upon the fugitives. Even that is not enough. A
few escape, and, in order to give the Israelites time
to pursue them, nature suspends its eternal laws.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
The sun halts at Gibeon, and the moon at Aijalon.
We do not quite understand how the moon comes
in, but the books of Joshua leave no room for doubt
as to the fact. Now let us pass to other miracles,
and go on to Samson, who is depicted as a famous
plunderer, a friend of God. Samson routs a thousand
Philistines with the jawbone of an ass, because
he is not shaved, and ties by the tails three
hundred foxes which he found in a certain place.</p>

<p>There is hardly a page that does not contain
similar stories. In one place it is the shade of
Samuel appearing in response to the voice of a
witch; in another it is the shadow on a sun-dial
(assuming that these miserable folk had sun-dials)
receding ten degrees at the prayer of Hezekiah, who
prudently asks for this sign. God gives him the
alternatives of advancing or retarding the hour, and
Dr. Hezekiah thinks that it is not difficult to put
the shadow on, but very difficult to put it back.</p>

<p>Elias rises to heaven in a fiery chariot; children
sing in a fiery furnace. I should never come to
an end if I wished to enter into all the details of
the unheard-of extravagances that swarm in this
book. Never was common-sense assailed with such
indecency and fury.</p>

<p>Such is, from one end to the other, the Old
Testament, the father of the New, a father who
disavows his child and regards it as a rebellious
bastard; for the Jews, faithful to the law of Moses,
regard with detestation the Christianity that has
been reared on the ruins of their law. The Christians,
however, have with great subtlety sought to
justify the New Testament by the Old. The two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
religions thus fight each other with the same weapons;
they invoke the same prophets and appeal
to the same predictions.</p>

<p>Will the ages to come, which will have seen the
passing of these follies, yet may, unhappily, witness
the rise of others not less unworthy of God
and men, believe that Judaism and Christianity
based their claims on such foundations and such
prophecies? What prophecies! Listen. The prophet
Isaiah is summoned by Ahaz, king of Judah,
to make certain predictions to him, in the vain and
superstitious manner of the East. These prophets
were, as you know, men who earned more or less
of a living by divination; there were many like
them in Europe in the last century, especially
among the common people. King Ahaz, besieged
in Jerusalem by Shalmaneser, who had taken
Samaria, demanded of the soothsayer a prophecy
and a sign. Isaiah said to him: This is the sign:</p>

<p>“A girl will conceive, and will bear a child who
shall be called Emmanuel. He shall eat butter and
honey until the day when he shall reject evil and
choose good; and before this child is of age, the
land which thou detestest shall be forsaken by its
two kings; and the Lord shall hiss for the flies
that are on the banks of the streams of Egypt and
Assyria; and the Lord will take a razor, and shave
the King of Assyria; he will shave his head and the
hair of his feet.”</p>

<p>After this splendid prophecy, recorded in <cite>Isaiah</cite>,
but of which there is not a word in <cite>Kings</cite>, the
prophet orders him first to write on a large roll,
which they hasten to seal. He urges the king to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
press to the plunder of his enemies, and then ensures
the birth of the predicted child. Instead of
calling it Emmanuel, however, he gives it the name
of Maher Salabas. This, my brethren, is the passage
which Christians have distorted in favour of
their Christ; this is the prophecy that set up Christianity.
The girl to whom the prophet ascribes a
child is incontestably the Virgin Mary.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Maher
Salabas is Jesus Christ. As to the butter and
honey, I am unaware what it means. Each soothsayer
promises the Jews deliverance when they are
captive; and this deliverance is, according to
the Christians, the heavenly Jerusalem, and the
Church of our time. Prophecy is everything with
the Jews; with the Christians miracle is everything,
and all the prophecies are figures of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>Here, my brethren, is one of these fine and striking
prophecies. The great prophet Ezekiel sees a
wind from the north, and four animals, and wheels
of chrysolite full of eyes; and the Lord says to
him: “Rise, eat a book, and then depart.”</p>

<p>The Lord orders him to sleep three hundred and
ninety days on the left side, and then forty on the
right side. The Lord binds him with cords; he was
certainly a man that needed binding. What follows
in Ezekiel is very distasteful.</p>

<p>But we need not waste our time in assailing all
the disgusting and abominable dreams which are
the subject of controversy between the Jews and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
Christians. We will be content to deplore the most
pitiful blindness that has ever darkened the mind
of man. Let us hope that this blindness will pass
like so many others, and let us proceed to the New
Testament, a worthy sequel to what has gone before.</p>


<h4><em>Third Point</em></h4>

<p>Vain was it that the Jews were a little more
enlightened in the time of Augustus than in the
barbaric ages of which we have spoken. Vainly
did the Jews begin to recognise the immortality of
the soul, a dogma unknown to Moses, and the idea
of God rewarding the just after death and punishing
the wicked, a dogma equally unknown to Moses.
Reason none the less penetrated this miserable people,
from whom issued the Christian religion, which
has proved the source of so many divisions, civil
wars, and crimes; which has caused so much blood
to flow; and which is broken into so many sects in
the corner of the earth where it rules.</p>

<p>There were at all times among the Jews people
of the lowest order, who made prophecies in order
to distinguish themselves from the populace. We
deal here with the one who has become best known,
and has been turned into a god; we give a brief
account of his career, as it is described in the books
called the gospels. We need not seek to determine
when these books were written; it is evident that
they were written after the fall of Jerusalem. You
know how absurdly the four authors contradict
each other. It is a demonstrative proof that they
are wrong. We do not, however, need many proofs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
to demolish this miserable structure. We will be
content with a short and faithful account.</p>

<p>In the first place, Jesus is described as a descendant
of Abraham and David, and the writer
Matthew counts forty-two generations in two thousand
years. In his list, however, we find only
forty-one, and in the genealogical tree which he
borrows from <cite>Kings</cite> he blunders clumsily in making
Josiah the father of Jechoniah.</p>

<p>Luke also gives a genealogy, but he assigns forty-nine
generations after Abraham, and they are entirely
different generations. To complete the absurdity,
these generations belong to Joseph, and
the evangelists assure us that Jesus was not the
son of Joseph. Would one be received in a German
chapter on such proofs of nobility? Yet there is
question here of the son of God, and God himself
is the author of the book!</p>

<p>Matthew says that when Jesus, King of the Jews,
was born in a stable in the town of Bethlehem, three
magi or kings saw his star in the east, and followed
it, until it halted over Bethlehem; and that King
Herod, hearing these things, caused all the children
under two years of age to be put to death. Could
any horror be more ridiculous? Matthew adds that
the father and mother took the child into Egypt,
and remained there until the death of Herod. Luke
says precisely the contrary; he observes that Joseph
and Mary remained peacefully at Bethlehem for six
weeks, then went to Jerusalem, and from there to
Nazareth; and that they went every year to
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The evangelists contradict each other in regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
to the time of the life of Jesus, his miracles, the
night of the supper, and the day of his death&mdash;in
a word, in regard to nearly all the facts. There
were forty-nine gospels composed by the Christians
of the first few centuries, and these were still more
flagrant in their contradictions. In the end, the
four which we have were selected. Even if they
were in harmony, what folly, what misery, what
puerile and odious things they contain!</p>

<p>The first adventure of Jesus, son of God, is to
be taken up by the devil; the devil, who makes no
appearance in the books of Moses, plays a great
part in the gospels. The devil, then, takes God up
a mountain in the desert. From there he shows
him all the kingdoms of the earth. Where is this
mountain from which one can see so many lands?
We do not know.</p>

<p>John records that Jesus goes to a marriage-feast,
and changes water into wine; and that he drives
from the precincts of the temple those who were
selling the animals of the sacrifices ordered in the
Jewish law.</p>

<p>All diseases were at that time regarded as possession
by the devil, and Jesus makes it the mission
of his apostles to expel devils. As he goes along,
he delivers one who was possessed by a legion of
devils, and he makes these devils enter a herd of
swine, which cast themselves into the sea of Tiberias.
We may suppose that the owners of the
swine, who were not Jews apparently, were not
pleased with this comedy. He heals a blind man,
and the blind man sees men as if they were trees.
He wishes to eat figs in winter, and, not finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
any on a tree, he curses the tree and causes it to
wither; the text prudently adds: “For it was not
the season of figs.”</p>

<p>He is transformed during the night, and causes
Moses and Elias to appear. Do the stories of
romancers even approach these absurdities? At
length, after constantly insulting the Pharisees,
calling them “races of vipers,” “whitened sepulchres,”
etc., he is handed over by them to justice,
and executed with two thieves; and the historians
are bold enough to tell us that at his death the
earth was darkened at midday, and at a time of
full moon. As if every writer of the time would
not have mentioned so strange a miracle.</p>

<p>After that it is a small matter to make him rise
from the dead and predict the end of the world;
which, however, has not happened.</p>

<p>The sect of Jesus lingers in concealment; fanaticism
increases. At first they dare not make a god
of this man, but they soon take courage. Some
Platonic metaphysic amalgamates with the Nazaræan
sect, and Jesus becomes the logos, the word
of God, then consubstantial with God his father.
The Trinity is invented; and, in order to have it
accepted, the first gospels are falsified.</p>

<p>A passage is added in regard to this truth, and
the historian Josephus is falsified and made to speak
of Jesus, though Josephus is too serious an historian
to mention such a man. They go so far as
to forge sibylline books. In a word, there is no
kind of trickery, fraud, and imposture that the
Nazaræans do not adopt. At the end of three years
they succeeded in having Jesus recognised as a god.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Not content with this extravagance, they go so far
as to locate their god in a bit of paste. While their
god is eaten by mice and digested, they hold that
there is no such thing as bread in the host; that
God has, at the word of a man, put himself in the
place of the bread. All kinds of superstitions flood
the Church; plunder is predominant in it; indulgences,
benefices, and all kinds of spiritual things
are put up for sale.</p>

<p>The sect splits into a multitude of sects; age after
age they fight and slaughter each other. At every
dispute kings and princes are massacred.</p>

<p>Such, my dear brethren, is the fruit of the tree
of the Cross, the power that has been declared
divine.</p>

<p>For this they have dared to bring God upon the
earth; to commit Europe for ages to murder and
brigandage. It is true that our fathers have in
part shaken off this frightful yoke, and rid themselves
of some errors and superstitions. But how
imperfect they have left the work! Everything tells
us that it is time to complete it; to destroy utterly
the idol of which we have as yet broken only a
finger or two. Numbers of theologians have already
embraced Socinianism (Unitarianism), which
comes near to the worship of one God, freed from
superstition. England, Germany, and the provinces
of France are full of wise doctors, who ask only
the opportunity to break away. There are great
numbers in other countries. Why persist in teaching
what we do not believe, and make ourselves
guilty before God of this great sin?</p>

<p>We are told that the people need mysteries, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
must be deceived. My brethren, dare any one commit
this outrage on humanity? Have not our
fathers already taken from the people their transubstantiation,
auricular confession, indulgences,
exorcisms, false miracles, and ridiculous statues?
Are not the people accustomed to the deprivation
of this food of superstition? We must have the
courage to go a few steps farther. The people are
not so weak of mind as is thought; they will easily
admit a wise and simple cult of one God, such as
was professed, it is said, by Abraham and Noah,
and by all the sages of antiquity, and as is found
among the educated people of China. We seek not
to despoil the clergy of what the liberality of their
followers has given them; we wish them, since most
of them secretly laugh at the untruths they teach,
to join us in preaching the truth. Let them observe
that, while they now offend and dishonour the Deity,
they would, if they follow us, glorify him. What
incalculable good would be done by that happy
change? Princes and magistrates would be better
obeyed, the people would be tranquil, the spirit of
division and hatred would be expelled. They would
offer to God, in peace, the first fruits of their work.
There would assuredly be more righteousness on
the earth, for many weak-minded folk who hear
contempt expressed daily for the Christian superstition,
and know that it is ridiculed by the priests
themselves, thoughtlessly imagine that there is no
such thing as religion, and abandon themselves to
excesses. But when they learn that the Christian
sect is really only a perversion of natural religion;
when reason, freed from its chains, teaches the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
that there is but one God; that this God is the
common parent of all men, who are brothers; that,
as brothers, they must be good and just to each
other, and practise every virtue; that God, being
good and just, must reward virtue and punish crime;
then assuredly, my brethren, men will gain in
righteousness as they lose in superstition.</p>

<p>We begin by giving this example in secret, and
we trust that it will be followed in public.</p>

<p>May the great God who hears me&mdash;a God who
certainly could not be born of a girl, nor die on a
gibbet, nor be eaten in a morsel of paste, nor have
inspired this book with its contradictions, follies,
and horrors&mdash;may this God, creator of all worlds,
have pity on the sect of the Christians who blaspheme
him. May he bring them to the holy and
natural religion, and shower his blessing on the
efforts we make to have him worshipped. Amen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_QUESTIONS_OF_ZAPATA">THE QUESTIONS OF ZAPATA</h2>
</div>

<p class="pfs90">(<span class="smcap">Translated by Dr. Tamponet, of the Sorbonne</span>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><em><span class="smcap">The</span> licentiate Zapata, being appointed Professor
of Theology at the University of Salamanca, presented
these questions to a committee of doctors in
1629. They were suppressed. The Spanish copy is
in the Brunswick Library.</em></p>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Wise Masters</span>:</p>

<p>1º. How ought I to proceed with the object of
showing that the Jews, whom we burn by the hundred,
were for four thousand years God’s chosen
people?</p>

<p>2º. How could God, whom one cannot without
blasphemy regard as unjust, forsake the whole earth
for the little Jewish tribe, and then abandon this
little group for another, which, during two hundred
years, was even smaller and more despised?</p>

<p>3º. Why did he perform a number of incomprehensible
miracles in favour of this miserable nation
before the period which is called <em>historical</em>? Why
did he, some centuries ago, cease to perform them?
And why do we, who are God’s people, never witness
any?</p>

<p>4º. If God is the God of Abraham, why do you
burn the children of Abraham? And, when you burn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
them, why do you recite their prayers? How is it
that, since you worship the book of their law, you
put them to death for observing that law?</p>

<p>5º. How shall I reconcile the chronology of the
Chinese, Chaldæans, Phœnicians, and Egyptians
with that of the Jews? And how shall I reconcile
the forty different methods of calculation which I
find in the commentators? If I say that God dictated
the book, I may be told that God evidently is
not an expert in chronology.</p>

<p>6º. By what argument can I prove that the books
attributed to Moses were written by him in the
desert? How could he say that he wrote beyond
the Jordan when he never crossed the Jordan? I
may be told that God is evidently not good at
geography.</p>

<p>7º. The book entitled <cite>Joshua</cite> says that Joshua
had <cite>Deuteronomy</cite> engraved on stones coated with
mortar; this passage in <cite>Joshua</cite>, and others in
ancient writers, clearly prove that in the days
of Moses and Joshua the peoples of the East
engraved their laws and observations on stone and
brick. The Pentateuch tells us that the Jewish
people were without food and clothing in the desert;
it seems hardly probable that, if they had no tailors
or shoemakers, they had men who were able to
engrave a large book. In any case, how did they
preserve this large work inscribed in mortar?</p>

<p>8º. What is the best way to refute the objections
of the learned men who find in the Pentateuch the
names of towns which were not yet in existence;
precepts for kings whom the Jews detested, and who
did not reign until seven hundred years after Moses;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and passages in which the author betrays that he
was much later than Moses, as: “The bed of Og,
which is still seen in Ramath,” “The Canaanite was
then in the land,” etc., etc., etc., etc.?</p>

<p>These learned men might, with the difficulties and
contradictions which they impute to the Jewish
chronicles, give some trouble to a licentiate.</p>

<p>9º. Is the book of <cite>Genesis</cite> to be taken literally
or allegorically? Did God really take a rib from
Adam and make woman therewith? and, if so, why
is it previously stated that he made man male and
female? How did God create light before the sun?
How did he separate light from darkness, since
darkness is merely the absence of light? How
could there be a day before the sun was made?
How was the firmament made amid the waters,
since there is no such thing as a firmament?&mdash;it is
an illusion of the ancient Greeks. There are those
who suggest that <cite>Genesis</cite> was not written until the
Jews had some knowledge of the erroneous philosophy
of other peoples, and it would pain me to
hear it said that God knows no more about physics
than he does about chronology and geography.</p>

<p>10º. What shall I say of the garden of Eden,
from which issued a river which divided into four
rivers&mdash;the Tigris, Euphrates, Phison (which is believed
to be the Phasis), and Gihon, which flows in
Ethiopia, and must therefore be the Nile, the source
of which is a thousand miles from the source of
the Euphrates? I shall be told once more that God
is a very poor geographer.</p>

<p>11º. I should, with all my heart, like to eat the
fruit which hung from the tree of knowledge; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
it seems to me that the prohibition to eat it is
strange. Since God endowed man with reason, he
ought to encourage him to advance in knowledge.
Did he wish to be served only by fools? I should
also like to have speech with the serpent, since it
was so intelligent; but I should like to know what
language it spoke. The Emperor Julian, a great
philosopher, asked this of the great St. Cyril, who
could not meet the question, and said to the learned
emperor: “You are the serpent.” St. Cyril was not
polite; but you will observe that he did not perpetrate
this theological impertinence until Julian
was dead.</p>

<p><cite>Genesis</cite> says that the serpent eats earth; you
know that <cite>Genesis</cite> is wrong, and that earth alone
contains no nourishment. In regard to God walking
familiarly every day in the garden, and talking
to Adam and Eve and the serpent, I may say that
it would have been very pleasant to have been there.
But as I think you are much more fitted for the
kind of society which Joseph and Mary had in the
stable at Bethlehem, I will not advise you to visit
the garden of Eden, especially as the gate is now
guarded by a cherub armed to the teeth. It is
true that, according to the rabbis, <em>cherub</em> means
“ox.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> A curious kind of porter! Please let me
know at least what a cherub is.</p>

<p>12º. How shall I explain the story of the angels
who fell in love with the daughters of men, and
begot giants? May I not be told that this episode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
is borrowed from pagan legends? But as the Jews
invented everything in the desert, and were very
ingenious, it is clear that all the other nations took
their science from the Jews. Homer, Plato, Cicero,
and Vergil learned all they knew from the Jews.
Is not that proved?</p>

<p>13º. How shall I get out of the deluge, the
cataracts of heaven (which has no cataracts),
and the animals coming from Japan, Africa,
America, and the south, and being enclosed in
a large ark with food and drink for one year,
without counting the time when the earth was
still too damp to produce food for them? How
did Noah’s little family manage to give all these
animals their proper food? It consisted only of
eight persons.</p>

<p>14º. How can I make the story of the tower of
Babel plausible? This tower must have been higher
than the pyramids of Egypt, since God allowed the
building of the pyramids. Did it reach as high as
Venus, or at least to the moon?</p>

<p>15º. By what device shall I justify the two lies
of Abraham, the father of believers, who, at the
age of one hundred and thirty-five (counting carefully),
represented the pretty Sarah as his sister
in Egypt and at Gerar, in order that the kings of
those countries might fall in love with her and
make presents to him? What a naughty thing to
do, to sell one’s wife!</p>

<p>16º. Give me some explanation why, although
God told Abraham that all his posterity should be
circumcised, this was not done under Moses.</p>

<p>17º. Can I know by my natural powers whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
the three angels, to whom Sarah offered a whole
calf to eat, had bodies, or borrowed bodies?</p>

<p>18º. Will my hearers believe me when I tell them
that Lot’s wife was changed into a salt statue?
What shall I say to those who tell me that it is
probably a coarse imitation of the ancient fable of
Eurydice, and that a salt statue would not last
in the rain?</p>

<p>19º. What shall I say in justification of the
blessings which fell on Jacob, the just man, who
deceived his father Isaac and robbed his father-in-law
Laban? How shall I explain God appearing
to him at the top of a ladder? And how could
Jacob fight an angel all night?, etc., etc.</p>

<p>20º. How must I treat the sojourn of the Jews
in Egypt and their escape? <cite>Exodus</cite> says that they
remained four hundred years in Egypt; but, counting
carefully, we find only two hundred and five
years. Why did Pharaoh’s daughter bathe in the
Nile, in which no one ever bathes on account of
the crocodiles?, etc., etc.</p>

<p>21º. Moses having wedded the daughter of an
idolater, how could God choose him as his prophet
without reproaching him? How could Pharaoh’s
magicians work the same miracles as Moses, except
that of covering the land with lice and vermin?
How could they change into blood all the waters,
since these had already been changed into blood
by Moses? How was it that Moses, led by God
himself, and at the head of six hundred and
thirty thousand fighting men, fled with his people,
instead of taking Egypt, in which God had
slain all the first-born? Egypt never had an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
army of a hundred thousand men, from the first
mention of it in historical times. How was it that
Moses, flying with his troops from the land of
Goshen, crossed half of Egypt, instead of going
straight to Canaan, and advanced as far as Memphis,
between Baal-Sephon and the Red Sea?
Finally, how could Pharaoh pursue him with all
his cavalry when, in the fifth plague of Egypt, God
had just destroyed all the horses and beasts in the
country, and, moreover, Egypt, which is much broken
by canals, always had very little cavalry?</p>

<p>22º. How shall I reconcile what is said in
<cite>Exodus</cite> with the speech of St. Stephen in <cite>Acts</cite> and
the passages of <cite>Jeremiah</cite> and <cite>Amos</cite>? <cite>Exodus</cite> says
that they sacrificed to Jehovah for forty years in
the desert; Jeremiah, Amos, and St. Stephen say
that neither sacrifice nor victim was offered during
all that time. <cite>Exodus</cite> says that they made the
tabernacle, which contained the ark of the covenant;
St. Stephen, in <cite>Acts</cite>, says that they took the
tabernacle from Moloch and Remphan.</p>

<p>23º. I am not sufficiently versed in chemistry to
deal happily with the golden calf which, <cite>Exodus</cite> says,
was made in a day, and which Moses reduced to
ashes. Are they two miracles, or two possibilities
of human art?</p>

<p>24º. Was it a further miracle for the leader of
a nation, in a desert, to have twenty-three thousand
men of that nation slain by a single one of the
twelve tribes, and for twenty-three thousand men
to let themselves be massacred without making any
defence?</p>

<p>25º. Must I again regard it as a miracle, or as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
an act of ordinary justice, that twenty-four thousand
Hebrews were put to death because one of
them had lain with a Midianite woman, while Moses
himself had married a Midianite? And were not
these Hebrews, who are described to us as so ferocious,
really very good fellows to let themselves be
slain for girls?</p>

<p>26º. What explanation shall I give of the law
which forbids the eating of the hare “because it
ruminates, and has not a cloven foot,” whereas hares
have cloven feet and do not ruminate? We have
already seen that this remarkable book suggests that
God is a poor geographer, a poor chronologist, and
a poor physicist; he seems to have been no less weak
in natural history. How can I explain other equally
wise laws, such as that of the waters of jealousy
and the sentence of death on a man who lies with
his wife during the menstrual period? etc., etc., etc.
Can I justify these barbaric and ridiculous laws,
which are said to have been given by God himself?</p>

<p>27º. What answer shall I make to those who
are surprised that a miracle was needed to effect
the crossing of the Jordan, since it is only forty-five
feet across at its widest, could easily be crossed
with a small raft, and was fordable at many points,
as we learn from the slaying of forty-two thousand
Ephraimites by their brothers at a ford of the same
river?</p>

<p>28º. What reply shall I make to those who ask
how the walls of Jericho fell at the sound of a
trumpet, and why other towns did not fall in the
same way?</p>

<p>29º. How shall I excuse the conduct of the harlot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Rahab in betraying her country, Jericho? How
was this treachery necessary, since they had only
to blow their trumpet to take a town? And how
shall I fathom the depth of the divine decrees which
enacted that our divine Saviour Jesus Christ should
descend from this harlot Rahab, from the incest of
Thamar with her father-in-law Judah, and from the
adultery of David and Bathsheba? How incomprehensible
are the ways of God!</p>

<p>30º. How can I approve of Joshua hanging
thirty-one kinglets and usurping their little States&mdash;that
is to say, their villages?</p>

<p>31º. How shall I speak of the battle of Joshua
with the Amorites at Beth-horon on the way to
Gibeon? The Lord sends a rain of stones, from
Beth-horon to Azekah: it is fifteen miles from Beth-horon
to Azekah; therefore the Amorites were exterminated
by rocks which fell from heaven over
a space of fifteen miles. The Scripture says that
it was midday. Why, then, did Joshua command
the sun and the moon to stand still in the middle
of the sky in order to give him time to complete
the defeat of a small troop which was already exterminated?
Why did he tell the moon to stand
still at midday? How could the sun and moon remain
in the same place for a day? Which commentator
shall I consult for an explanation of this
extraordinary truth?</p>

<p>32º. What shall I say of Jephthah immolating
his daughter, and having forty-two thousand Jews
of the tribe of Ephraim, who could not say <em>Shibboleth</em>,
put to death?</p>

<p>33º. Ought I to admit or deny that the Jewish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
law nowhere speaks of punishment or reward after
death? How is it that neither Moses nor Joshua
ever spoke of the immortality of the soul, a dogma
well known to the ancient Egyptians, Chaldæans,
Persians, and Greeks, but hardly known to the
Jews until after the time of Alexander, and always
rejected by the Sadducees because it is not in the
Pentateuch?</p>

<p>34º. What gloss must I put on the story of the
Levite who, coming on his ass to the Benjamite
town Gibeah, excited the passion of all the Gibeonites?
He abandoned his wife to them, and she died
the next day.</p>

<p>35º. I need your advice to enable me to understand
the nineteenth verse of the first chapter of
<cite>Judges</cite>: “And the Lord was with Judah: and he
drave out the inhabitants of the mountain: but
could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,
because they had chariots of iron.” I cannot, of
my own feeble lights, understand how the God of
heaven and earth, who had so often superseded the
order of nature and suspended the eternal laws in
favour of the Jewish people, was unable to vanquish
the inhabitants of a valley because they had iron
chariots. Can it be true that, as some learned men
say, the Jews at that time regarded their God as
a local and protecting deity, sometimes more powerful,
at other times less powerful, than the gods of
the enemy? And is this not proved by the reply
of Jephthah: “Ye possess by right what your god
Camos has given you: suffer then that we take what
our god Adonai has promised us”?</p>

<p>36º. I may add that it is difficult to believe that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
there were so many chariots armed with scythes in
a mountainous district, in which, as the Scriptures
often show, the height of magnificence was to be
mounted on an ass.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>37º. The story of Ehud gives me even greater
trouble. I see that the Jews were always in bondage,
in spite of the help of their God, who had
sworn to give them all the country between the
Nile, the sea, and the Euphrates. For eighteen
years they were subject to a petty king named
Eglon, when God raised up for them Ehud, son of
Gera, who used his left hand as well as the right.
Ehud, son of Gera, made a two-edged sword, and
hid it under his cloak&mdash;as Jacques Clément and
Ravaillac did afterwards. He asks a private audience
of the king, saying that he has a secret of the
utmost importance to communicate to him from God.
Eglon respectfully rises, and Ehud drives his sword
into his belly with his left hand. God entirely
approved this deed; but, judged by the moral code
of all nations, it seems rather questionable. Please
tell me which was the most divine assassination,
that of St. Ehud, or that of St. David (who had
Uriah, the husband of his mistress, slain), or that
of the blessed Solomon, who, having seven hundred
wives and three hundred concubines, assassinated
his brother Adonias because he asked for one of
them? etc., etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span></p>

<p>38º. I pray you tell me by what trick Samson
caught three hundred foxes, tied them together by
their tails, and fastened lighted torches to their
hind quarters, in order to set fire to the harvests
of the Philistines. Foxes are found only in wooded
country. There was no forest in this district, and
it seems rather difficult to catch three hundred
foxes alive and tie them together by their tails. It
is then said that he killed a thousand Philistines
with the jaw of an ass, and that a spring issued
from one of the teeth of this jaw. When it comes
to the jaws of asses, you certainly owe me
explanations.</p>

<p>39º. I also ask you for information about that
good man Tobias, who slept with his eyes open, and
was blinded by the droppings of a swallow; about
the angel who came down expressly from what is
called the empyrean to seek, with Tobias junior, the
money which the Jew Gabel owed to Tobias senior;
about the wife of Tobias junior, who had had seven
husbands whose necks had been wrung by the devil;
and about the way to restore sight to the blind
with the gall of a fish. These stories are curious,
and nothing is more worthy of attention&mdash;after
Spanish novels; the only things to which they may
be compared are the stories of Judith and Esther.
But how am I to interpret the sacred text which
says that the beautiful Judith descended from
Simeon, son of Reuben, whereas Simeon was the
brother of Reuben, according to the same sacred
text, which cannot lie?</p>

<p>I am very fond of Esther, and think the alleged
King Assuerus acted very sensibly in marrying a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Jewess and living with her for six months without
knowing who she was. As all the rest of the story
is of much the same character, I must ask you
kindly to come to my assistance, my wise masters.</p>

<p>40º. I need your help in regard to the history of
the kings, at least as much as in regard to the
history of the judges, of Tobias and his dog, of
Esther, of Judith, of Ruth, etc., etc. When Saul was
appointed king, the Jews were in bondage to the
Philistines. Their conquerors did not allow them
to have swords or lances; they were even compelled
to go to the Philistines to have their ploughshares
and axes sharpened. Nevertheless, Saul gives battle
to the Philistines and defeats them; and in this
battle he is at the head of three hundred and thirty
thousand soldiers, in a little country that cannot
sustain thirty thousand souls. The Jews had not
at that time more than a third of Palestine, at the
most, and so sterile a country does not sustain
twenty thousand inhabitants to-day. The surplus
population was compelled to go and earn its living
by prostitution at Damascus, Tyre, and Babylon.</p>

<p>41º. I know not how I can justify the conduct
of Samuel in cutting into pieces Agag, whom Saul
had taken prisoner and put to ransom. I wonder
whether our king Philip, if he captured a Moorish
king, and made an agreement with him, would be
approved if he cut the captured king in pieces.</p>

<p>42º. We owe great respect to David, who was a
man after God’s heart; but I fear I am not learned
enough to justify, by ordinary laws, the conduct of
David in associating with four hundred men of
evil ways, and burdened with debt, as the Scripture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
says; in going to sack the house of the king’s
servant Nabal, and marrying his widow a week
later; in offering his services to Achish, the king’s
enemy, and spreading fire and blood over the land
of the allies of Achish, without sparing either age
or sex; in taking new concubines as soon as he is
on the throne; and, not content with these concubines,
in stealing Bathsheba from her husband,
whom he not only dishonours, but slays. I find
it difficult to imagine how God could afterwards
descend, in Judæa, from this adulterous and
homicidal woman, who is counted among the ancestresses
of the Eternal. I have already warned
you that this article causes much trouble to pious
souls.</p>

<p>43º. The wealth of David and Solomon, which
amounted to more than five hundred thousand million
gold ducats, seems to be not easily reconciled
with the poverty of the country and with the condition
to which the Jews were reduced under Saul,
when they had not the means of sharpening their
ploughshares and axes. Our cavalry officers will
shrug their shoulders when I tell them that Solomon
had four hundred thousand horses in a little country
where there never were, and are not to-day,
anything but asses, as I have already had the honour
to represent to you.</p>

<p>44º. If I were to run over the history of the
frightful cruelties of nearly all the kings of Judah
and Israel, I fear I should scandalise, rather than
edify, the weak. These kings assassinate each other
a little too frequently. It is bad politics, if I am
not mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span></p>

<p>45º. I see this small people almost always in
bondage to the Phœnicians, Babylonians, Persians,
Syrians, or Romans; and I may have some trouble
in reconciling so much misery with the magnificent
promises of their prophets.</p>

<p>46º. I know that all the eastern nations had
prophets, but I do not quite understand those of
the Jews. What is the meaning of the vision of
Ezekiel, son of Buzi, near the river Chebar; of the
four animals which had four faces and four wings
each, with the feet of calves; of the wheel that had
four faces; and of the firmament above the heads
of the animals? How can we explain the order
given by God to Ezekiel to eat a parchment book,
to have himself bound, and to lie on his left side
for three hundred and ninety days, and on his right
side for forty days?</p>

<p>47º. It will be my duty to explain the great
prophecy of Isaiah in regard to our Lord Jesus
Christ. It is, as you know, in the seventh chapter.
Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, kinglet of Israel,
were besieging Jerusalem. Ahaz, kinglet of Jerusalem,
consults the prophet Isaiah as to the issue
of the siege. Isaiah replies: “God shall give you
a sign: a girl (or woman) shall conceive and bear
a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. Butter
and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse
the evil and choose the good. For before the child
shall be able to refuse the evil and choose the good
the land shall be delivered of both the kings, ...
and the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the
uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the
bee that is in the land of Assyria.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<p>Then, in the eighth chapter, the prophet, to ensure
the fulfilment of the prophecy, lies with the prophetess.
She bore a son, and the Lord said to Isaiah:
“Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz [Hasten-to-seize-the-spoil,
or Run-quickly-to-the-booty]. For
before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My
father and my mother, the power of Damascus shall
be overthrown.” I cannot plainly interpret this
prophecy without your assistance.</p>

<p>48º. How must I understand the story of Jonah,
who was sent to Nineveh to preach penance?
Nineveh was not Israelitic, and it seems that Jonah
was to instruct it in the Jewish law before bringing
it to repent. Instead of obeying the Lord, Jonah
flies to Tarshish. A storm arises, and the sailors
throw Jonah into the sea to appease the tempest.
God sends a great fish to swallow Jonah, and he
remains three days and three nights in the belly
of the fish. God orders the fish to give up Jonah,
and it obeys. Jonah disembarks on the coast of
Joppa. God commands him to go and tell Nineveh
that in forty days it will be overturned, unless it
does penance. It is more than four hundred miles
from Joppa to Nineveh. Do not all the stories demand
a superior knowledge which I lack? I greatly
wish to confound the learned men who assert that
this legend is taken from the legend of the ancient
Hercules.</p>

<p>49º. Show me how to interpret the first verses
of the prophet Hosea. God explicitly enjoins him
to take a harlot and have children by her. The
prophet obeys punctually. He pays his respects
to Dona Gomer, daughter of Dom Diblaim, keeps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
her three years, and has three children&mdash;which is
a model. Then God desires another model. He
orders him to lie with another gay lady, a married
woman, who has already deceived her husband.
The good Hosea, always obedient, has no trouble
in finding a handsome lady of this character, and
it costs him only fifteen pieces of silver and a
measure of barley. I beg you to tell me how much
the piece of silver was worth among the Jews.</p>

<p>50º. I have still greater need of your wise guidance
in regard to the New Testament. I hardly
know what to say when I have to reconcile the two
genealogies of Jesus. I shall be reminded that
Matthew makes Jacob the father of Joseph, while
Luke makes him the son of Heli, and that this is
impossible unless we change <em>He</em> into <em>Ja</em> and <em>li</em>
into <em>cob</em>. I shall be asked why the one counts
fifty-six generations and the other only forty-two,
and why the generations are quite different; and
then why only forty-one are given instead of the
promised forty-two; and lastly why the genealogical
tree of Joseph was given at all, seeing that he was
not the father of Jesus. I fear to make a fool of
myself, as so many of my predecessors have done.
I trust that you will extricate me from this
labyrinth.</p>

<p>51º. If I declare that, as Luke says, Augustus
had ordered a census to be taken of the whole earth
when Mary was pregnant, and that Cyrenius or
Quirinus, the governor of Syria, published the decree,
and that Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem
to be enumerated; and if people laugh at me, and
antiquarians teach me that there never was a census<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
of the Roman Empire, that Quintilius Varus,
not Cyrenius, was at that time governor of Syria,
and that Cyrenius only governed Syria ten years
after the birth of Jesus, I shall be very much embarrassed,
and no doubt you will extricate me from
this little difficulty. For how could a book be
inspired if there were one single untruth in it?</p>

<p>52º. When I teach that, as Matthew says, the
family went into Egypt, I shall be told that that
is not true, but that, as the other evangelists say,
the family remained in Judæa; and if I then grant
that they remained in Judæa, I shall be told that
they were in Egypt. Is it not simpler to say that
one can be in two places at once, as happened to
St. Francis Xavier and several other saints?</p>

<p>53º. Astronomers may laugh at the star which
led the three kings to a stable. But you are great
astrologers, and will be able to explain the phenomenon.
Tell me, especially, how much gold the
kings presented. For you are wont to extort a
good deal of it from kings and peoples. And in
regard to the fourth king, Herod, why did he fear
that Jesus, born in a stable, might become king of
the Jews? Herod was king only by permission of
the Romans; it was the business of Augustus. The
massacre of the innocents is rather curious. I am
disappointed that no Roman writer mentions it.
An ancient and most truthful (as they all are)
martyrology gives the number of these martyred
infants as fourteen thousand. If you would like
me to add a few thousand more, you have only to
say so.</p>

<p>54º. You will tell me how the devil carried off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
God and perched him on a hill in Galilee, from
which one could see all the kingdoms of the earth.
The devil promising these kingdoms to God, provided
God worships the devil, may scandalise many
good people, whom I recommend to your notice.</p>

<p>55º. I beg you, when you go to a wedding feast,
to tell me how God, who also went to a wedding
feast, succeeded in changing water into wine for
the sake of people who were already drunk.</p>

<p>56º. When you eat figs at breakfast towards the
end of July, I beg you to tell me why God, being
hungry, looked for figs at the beginning of the
month of March, when it was not the season of
figs.</p>

<p>57º. Having received your instructions on all
the prodigies of this nature, I shall have to say
that God was condemned to be executed for original
sin. And if I am told that there was never any
question of original sin, either in the Old or the
New Testament; that it is merely stated that Adam
was condemned to die on the day on which he
should eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge, and
he did not die; and that Augustine, bishop of Hippo,
formerly a Manichean, was the first to set up the
doctrine of original sin, I submit to you that, as
my hearers are not the simple folk of Hippo, I run
some risk of exciting derision by speaking much
without saying anything. When certain cavillers
came to show me that God could not possibly be
executed because an apple was eaten four thousand
years before his death, and could not possibly have
redeemed the human race, yet, apart from a chosen
few, left the whole of it in the devil’s claws, I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
only verbiage to give in reply, and went away to
hide my shame.</p>

<p>58º. Throw some light for me on the prophecy
which Our Lord makes in <cite>Luke</cite> (ch. xxi.). Jesus
says explicitly that he will come in a cloud with
great power and great glory before the generation
to which he speaks shall pass away. He did not
do this; he did not come in the clouds. If he came
in some fog or other, we know nothing about it;
tell me what you think. The Apostle Paul also
says to his Thessalonian disciples that they will go
with him in the clouds to Jesus. Why did they not
go? Does it cost more to go to the clouds than
to the third heaven? I beg your forgiveness, but
I prefer the clouds of Aristophanes to those of Paul.</p>

<p>59º. Shall I say with Luke that Jesus went up
to heaven from the little village of Bethany? Shall
I state with Matthew that it was from Galilee,
where the disciples saw him for the last time? Or
shall I take the word of a learned doctor who says
that Jesus had one foot in Bethany and another in
Galilee? The latter opinion seems to me the more
probable, but I will await your decision.</p>

<p>60º. I shall then be asked whether Peter was
ever at Rome. I shall reply, of course, that he was
pope there for twenty-five years; and the chief reason
I shall give is that we have an epistle from
the good man (who could neither read nor write),
and that it is dated from Babylon. There is no
answer to that argument, but I should like something
stronger.</p>

<p>61º. Please tell me why the “Apostles’ Creed”
was not written until the time of Jerome and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Rufinus, four hundred years after the apostles. Tell
me why the earliest fathers of the Church never
quote any but the gospels which we call apocryphal.
Is it not a clear proof that the four canonical
gospels had not yet been written?</p>

<p>62º. Are you not sorry, as I am, that the early
Christians forged so much bad poetry, and attributed
it to the Sibyls? And that they forged letters
of Paul and Seneca, of Jesus, of Mary, and of
Pilate? And that they thus set up their sect on
a hundred forgeries which would be punished to-day
by any court in the world? These frauds are now
recognised by all scholars. We are reduced to calling
them “pious.” But is it not sad that your
truth should be based on lies?</p>

<p>63º. Tell me why, since Jesus did not institute
seven sacraments, we have seven sacraments<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; why,
whereas Jesus never said that he was threefold and
had two natures and two wills and one person, we
make him threefold, with one person and two natures;
and why, having two wills, he had not the will
to instruct us in the dogmas of the Christian
religion.</p>

<p>64º. Is the pope infallible when he consorts with
his mistress, and when he brings to supper a bottle
of poisoned wine for Cardinal Cornetto?<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> When
two councils anathematise each other, as has often
happened, which of them is infallible?</p>

<p>65º. Would it not really be better to avoid these
labyrinths, and simply preach virtue? When God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
comes to judge us, I doubt very much if he will
ask us whether grace is versatile or concomitant,
whether marriage is the visible sign of an invisible
thing, whether we believe that there are ten choirs
of angels or nine, whether the pope is above the
council or the council above the pope. Will it be
a crime in his eyes to have prayed to him in Spanish
when one does not know Latin? Shall we be visited
with his cruel wrath for having eaten a penny-worth
of bad meat on a certain day? And shall
we be eternally rewarded if, like you, my learned
masters, we ate a hundred piastres’ worth of turbot,
sole, and sturgeon? You do not believe it in the
depth of your hearts; you believe that God will
judge you by your works, not by the opinions of
Thomas and Bonaventure.</p>

<p>Shall I not render a service to men in speaking
to them only of morality? This morality is so
pure, so holy, so universal, so clear, so ancient, that
it seems to come from God himself, like the light
which we regard as the first of his works. Has he
not given men self-love to secure their preservation;
benevolence, beneficence, and virtue to control their
self-love; the natural need to form a society; pleasure
to enjoy, pain to warn us to enjoy in moderation,
passions to spur us to great deeds, and wisdom
to curb our passions? Will you allow me to announce
these truths to the noble people of Spain?</p>

<p>66º. If you bid me conceal these truths, and
strictly enjoin me to announce the miracles of St.
James of Galicia, or of Our Lady of Atocha, or of
Maria d’Agreda (who in her ecstasies behaved in
a most improper manner), tell me what I must do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
with those who dare to doubt? Must I, for their
edification, have the ordinary and extraordinary
question put to them?<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>I await the honour of your reply,</p>

<p class="pad40pc"><span class="smcap">Dominico Zapata</span>,<br />
<span class="pad4">y verdadero, y honrado,</span><br />

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Zapata, receiving no answer, took to preaching
God in all simplicity. He announced to men the
common father, the rewarder, punisher, and pardoner.
He extricated the truth from the lies, and

practised virtue. He was gentle, kindly, and modest;

<h3 class="allsmcap">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not a question of taking sides between Russia
and Turkey; for these States will, sooner or later,
come to an understanding without my intervention.</p>

<p>It is not a question of declaring oneself in favour
of one English faction and against another; for
they will soon have disappeared, to make room for
others.</p>

<p>I am not endeavouring to choose between Greek
and Armenian Christians, Eutychians and Jacobites,
Christians who are called Papists and Lutherans,
Calvinists, Anglicans, the primitive folk called
Quakers, Anabaptists, Jansenists, Molinists, Socinians,
Pietists, and so many other ’ists. I wish to
live in peace with all these gentlemen, whenever I
may meet them, and never dispute with them; because
there is not a single one of them who, when
he has a crown to share with me, will not know
his business perfectly, or who would spend a single
penny for the salvation of my soul or his own.</p>

<p>I am not going to take sides between the old

years there will be no question of either of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span></p>

the trial would be endless.</p>

because they exist no longer, and, thank God, five

the works of St. Ephraim.</p>

<p>Nor between the partisans of the French and the
Italian opera; because it is a mere matter of fancy.</p>

<p>The subject I have in mind is but a trifle&mdash;namely,
the question whether there is or is not a
God; and I am going to examine it in all seriousness
and good faith, because it interests me, and
you also.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">I<br />
OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTION</h3>

<p>Everything is in motion, everything acts and
reacts, in nature.</p>

<p>Our sun turns on its axis with a rapidity that
astonishes us; other suns turn with the same speed,
while countless swarms of planets revolve round
them in their orbits, and the blood circulates more
than twenty times an hour in the lowliest of our
animals.</p>

<p>A straw that is borne on the wind tends naturally
towards the centre of the earth, just as the earth
gravitates towards the sun, and the sun towards the
earth. The sea owes to the same laws its eternal
ebb and flow. In virtue of the same laws the
vapours which form our atmosphere rise continually
from the earth, and fall again in dew, rain, hail,
snow, and thunder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
Everything, even death, is active. Corpses are
decomposed, transformed into plants, and nourish
the living, which in their turn are the food of
others. What is the principle of this universal
activity?</p>

<p>This principle must be unique. The unvarying
uniformity of the laws which control the march of
the heavenly bodies, the movements of our globe,
every species and genus of animal, plant, and mineral,
indicates that there is one mover. If there
were two, they would either differ, or be opposed
to each other, or like each other. If they were different,
there would be no harmony; if opposed,
things would destroy each other; if like, it would
be as if there were only one&mdash;a twofold employment.</p>

<p>I am encouraged in this belief that there can be
but one principle, one single mover, when I observe
the constant and uniform laws of the whole of
nature.</p>

<p>The same gravitation reaches every globe, and
causes them to tend towards each other in direct
proportion, not to their surfaces, which might be
the effect of an impelling fluid, but to their masses.</p>

<p>The square of the revolution of every planet is
as the cube of its distance from the sun (which
proves, one may note, what Plato had somehow
divined, that the world is the work of the eternal
geometrician).</p>

<p>The rays of light are reflected and refracted from
end to end of the universe. All the truths of mathematics
must be the same on the star Sirius as in
our little home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span></p>

<p>If I glance at the animal world, I find that all
quadrupeds, and all wingless bipeds, reproduce their
kind by the same process of copulation, and all the
females are viviparous.</p>

<p>All female birds lay eggs.</p>

<p>In each species there is the same manner of reproduction
and feeding.</p>

<p>Each species of plants has the same basic
qualities.</p>

<p>Assuredly the oak and the nut have come to no
agreement to be born and to grow in the same way,
any more than Mars and Saturn have come to an
understanding to observe the same laws. There is,
therefore, a single, universal, and powerful intelligence,
acting always by invariable laws.</p>

<p>No one doubts that an armillary sphere, landscapes,
drawings of animals, or models in coloured
wax, are the work of clever artists. Is it possible for
the copyists to be intelligent and the originals not?
This seems to me the strongest demonstration; I
do not see how it can be assailed.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">II<br />
OF THE NECESSARY AND ETERNAL PRINCIPLE OF ACTION</h3>

<p>This single mover is very powerful, since it
directs so vast and complex a machine. It is
very intelligent, since the smallest spring of this
machine cannot be equalled by us, who are intelligent
beings.</p>

<p>It is a necessary being, since without it the
machine would not exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>It is eternal, for it cannot be produced from
nothing, which, being nothing, can produce nothing;
given the existence of something, it is demonstrated
that something has existed for all eternity. This
sublime truth has become trivial. So great has
been the advance of the human mind in our time,
in spite of the efforts to brutalise us which the
masters of ignorance have made for so many
centuries.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">III<br />
WHAT IS THIS PRINCIPLE?</h3>

<p>I cannot prove synthetically the existence of the
principle of action, the prime mover, the Supreme
Being, as Dr. Clarke does. If this method were in
the power of man, Clarke was, perhaps, worthy to
employ it; but analysis seems to me more suitable
for our poor ideas. It is only by ascending the
stream of eternity that I can attempt to reach its
source.</p>

<p>Having therefore recognised from movement that
there is a mover; having proved from action that
there is a principle of action; I seek the nature of
this universal principle. And the first thing I perceive,
with secret distress but entire resignation,
is that, being an imperceptible part of the great
whole; being, as Plato says in the <cite>Timæus</cite>, a point
between two eternities; it will be impossible for me
to understand this great whole, which hems me
in on every side, and its master.</p>

<p>Yet I am a little reassured on seeing that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
able to measure the distance of the stars, and to
recognise the course and the laws which keep them
in their orbits. I say to myself: Perhaps, if I
use my reason in good faith, I may succeed in discovering
some ray of probability to lighten me in
the dark night of nature. And if this faint dawn
which I seek does not come to me, I shall be consoled
to think that my ignorance is invincible; that
knowledge which is forbidden me is assuredly useless
to me; and that the great Being will not
punish me for having sought a knowledge of him
and failed to obtain it.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">IV<br />
WHERE IS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE? IS IT INFINITE?</h3>

<p>I do not see the first motive and intelligent principle
of the animal called man, when he demonstrates
a geometrical proposition or lifts a burden.
Yet I feel irresistibly that there is one in him,
however subordinate. I cannot discover whether
this first principle is in his heart, or in his head,
or in his blood, or in his whole body. In the same
way I have detected a first principle in nature, and
have seen that it must necessarily be eternal. But
where is it?</p>

<p>If it animates all existence, it is in all existence:
that seems to be beyond doubt. It is in all that
exists, just as movement is in the whole body of
an animal, if one may use so poor a comparison.</p>

<p>But while it is in what exists, can it be in what
does not exist? Is the universe infinite? I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
told that it is; but who will prove it? I regard
it as eternal, because it cannot have been made from
nothing; because the great principle, “nothing
comes from nothing,” is as true as that two and
two make four; because, as we saw elsewhere, it is
an absurd contradiction to say that the active being
has spent an eternity without acting, the formative
being has been eternal without forming anything,
and the necessary being has been, during an eternity,
a useless being.</p>

<p>But I see no reason why this necessary being
should be infinite. Its nature seems to me to be
wherever there is existence; but why, and how, an
infinite existence? Newton has demonstrated the
void, which had until his time been a matter of
conjecture. If there is a void in nature, there may
be a void outside nature. What need is there that
beings should extend to infinity? What would an
infinite extension be? Nor can we have infinity in
number. There is no number and no extension to
which I cannot add. It seems to me that in this
matter the conclusion of Cudworth is preferable
to that of Clarke.</p>

<p>God is present everywhere, says Clarke. Yes,
doubtless; but everywhere where there is something,
not where there is not. To be present in nothing
seems to me a contradiction in terms, an absurdity.
I am compelled to admit eternity, but I am not
compelled to admit an actual infinity.</p>

<p>In fine, what does it matter to me whether space
is a reality or merely an idea in my mind? What
does it matter whether or no the necessary, intelligent,
powerful, eternal being, the former of all being,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
is in this imaginary space? Am I less his
work? Am I less dependent on him? Is he the
less my master? I see this master of the world
with the eyes of my mind, but I see him not beyond
the world.</p>

<p>It is still disputed whether or no infinite space
is a reality. I will not base my judgment on so
equivocal a point, a quarrel worthy of the scholastics.
I will not set up the throne of God in
imaginary spaces.</p>

<p>If it is allowable to compare once more the little
things which seem large to us to what is great in
reality, let us imagine a gentleman of Madrid trying
to persuade a Castilian neighbour that the king
of Spain is master of the sea to the north of California,
and that whoever doubts it is guilty of high
treason. The Castilian replies: I do not even know
whether there is a sea beyond California. It matters
little to me whether there is or not, provided
that I have the means of subsistence in Madrid. I
do not need this sea to be discovered to make me
faithful to the king my master on the banks of the
Manzanares. Whether or no there are vessels beyond
Hudson Bay, he has none the less power to
command me here; I feel my dependence on him
in Madrid, because I know that he is master of
Madrid.</p>

<p>In the same way, our dependence on the great
being is not due to the fact that he is present outside
the world, but to the fact that he is present
in the world. I do but ask pardon of the master
of nature for comparing him to a frail human being
in order to make my meaning clearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span></p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">V<br />
THAT ALL THE WORKS OF THE ETERNAL BEING ARE<br />
ETERNAL</h3>

<p>The principle of nature being necessary and eternal,
and its very essence being to act, it must have
been always active. If it had not been an ever-active
God, it would have been an eternally indolent
God, the God of Epicurus, the God who is good for
nothing. This truth seems to me to be fully
demonstrated.</p>

<p>Hence the world, his work, whatever form it assume,
is, like him, eternal; just as the light is as
old as the sun, movement as old as matter, and
food as old as the animals; otherwise the sun, matter,
and the animals would be, not merely useless,
but self-contradictory things, chimæras.</p>

<p>What, indeed, could be more contradictory than
an essentially active being that has been inactive
during an eternity; a formative being that has fashioned
nothing, or merely formed a few globes some
years ago, without there being the least apparent
reason for making them at one time rather than
another? The intelligent principle can do nothing
without reason; nothing can exist without an antecedent
and necessary reason. This antecedent and
necessary reason has existed eternally; therefore the
universe is eternal.</p>

<p>We speak here a strictly philosophical language;
it is not our part even to glance at those who use
the language of revelation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span></p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">VI<br />
THAT THE ETERNAL BEING, AND FIRST PRINCIPLE, HAS<br />
ARRANGED ALL THINGS VOLUNTARILY</h3>

<p>It is clear that this supreme, necessary, active
intelligence is possessed of will, and has arranged
all things because it<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> willed them. How can one
act, and fashion all things, without willing to fashion
them? That would be the action of a mere machine,
and this machine would presuppose another first
principle, another mover. We should always have
to end in a first intelligent being of some kind or
other. We wish, we act, we make machines, when
we will; hence the great very powerful <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Demiourgos</i>
has done all things because he willed.</p>

<p>Spinoza himself recognises in nature an intelligent,
necessary power. But an intelligence without
will would be an absurdity, since such an intelligence
would be useless; it would do nothing, because
it would not will to do anything. Hence the
great necessary being has willed everything that it
has done.</p>

<p>I said above that it has done all things necessarily
because, if its works were not necessary, they
would be useless. But does this necessity deprive
it of will? Certainly not. I necessarily will to be
happy, but I will it none the less on that account;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
on the contrary, I will it all the more strongly
because I will it irresistibly.</p>

<p>Does this necessity deprive it of liberty? Not
at all. Liberty can only be the power to act. Since
the supreme being is very powerful, it is the freest
of beings.</p>

<p>We thus recognise that the great artisan of things
is necessary, eternal, intelligent, powerful, possessed
of will, and free.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">VII<br />
THAT ALL BEINGS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, ARE SUBJECT<br />
TO ETERNAL LAWS</h3>

<p>What are the effects of this eternal power that
dwells essentially in nature? I see only two classes
of them, the insensitive and the sensitive.</p>

<p>The earth, the seas, the planets, the suns, seem
admirable but lifeless things, devoid of sensibility.
A snail that wills, has some degree of perception,
and makes love, seems, to that extent, to have an
advantage greater than all the glory of the suns
that illumine space.</p>

<p>But all these beings are alike subject to eternal
and unvarying laws.</p>

<p>Neither the sun, nor the snail, nor the oyster, nor
the dog, nor the ape, nor man, has given himself
any one of the things which he has; it is evident
that they have received everything.</p>

<p>Man and the dog are born, unwittingly, of a
mother who has brought them into the world in
spite of herself. Both of them suck the mother’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
breast without knowing what they do, and they do
this in virtue of a very delicate and complex
mechanism, the nature of which is known to few
men.</p>

<p>Both of them have, after a time, ideas, memory,
and will; the dog much earlier than the man.</p>

<p>If the animals were mere machines, it would be
another argument for the position of those who
believe that man also is a mere machine; but there
are now none who do not admit that the animals
have ideas, memory, and a measure of intelligence,
and that they improve their knowledge; that a
hunting-dog learns its work, an old fox is more
astute than a young one, and so on.</p>

<p>Whence have they these faculties, if not from the
primordial eternal cause, the principle of action,
the great being that animates the whole of nature?</p>

<p>Man obtains the faculties of the animals much
later than they, but in a higher degree; can he
obtain them from any other source?</p>

<p>He has nothing but what the great being has
given him. It would be a strange contradiction, a
singular absurdity, if all the stars and elements,
the animals and plants, obeyed, unceasingly and
irresistibly, the laws of the great being, and man
alone were independent of them.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">VIII<br />
THAT MAN IS ESSENTIALLY SUBJECT IN EVERYTHING<br />
TO THE ETERNAL LAWS OF THE FIRST PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p>Let us regard, with the eyes of reason, this animal
man which the great being has produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span></p>

<p>What is his first sensation? A sensation of
pain; then the pleasure of feeding. That is the
whole of our life: pain and pleasure. Whence have
we these two springs which keep us in action until
our last moment, if not from this first principle of
action, this Demiourgos? Assuredly we do not
give pain to ourselves; and how could we be the
cause of our few pleasures? We have said elsewhere
that it is impossible for us to invent a
new kind of pleasure&mdash;that is to say, a new
sense. Let us now say that it is equally impossible
for us to invent a new kind of pain. The most
execrable of tyrants cannot do it. The Jews, whose
tortures have been described by the Benedictine
monk Calmet in his dictionary, could only cut, tear,
mutilate, draw, burn, strangle, and crush; all torments
may thus be summarised. We can therefore
do nothing of ourselves, either for good or evil; we
are but the blind instruments of nature.</p>

<p>But I wish to think and I think, most men will
recklessly assert. Let us consider it. What was
our first idea after the feeling of pain? The idea
of the breast that we sucked; then the face of the
nurse; then a few other objects and needs made
their faint impressions. Would any one up to this
point venture to say that he was more than a sentient
automaton, a wretched abandoned animal destitute
of knowledge or power, an outcast of nature?
Will he venture to say that in this condition he
is a thinking being, the author of his own ideas,
the possessor of a soul? What is the son of a king
when he leaves the womb? He would excite the
disgust of his father, if he were not his father. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
flower of the field that one treads underfoot is an
infinitely superior thing.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">IX<br />
OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTION IN SENTIENT BEINGS</h3>

<p>There comes at length a time when a greater or
smaller number of perceptions, received in our
mechanism, seem to present themselves to our will.
We think that we are forming ideas. It is as if,
when we turn the tap of a fountain, we were to
think that we cause the water which streams out.
We create ideas, poor creatures that we are! It
is evident that we had no share in the former, yet
we would regard ourselves as the authors of the
latter. If we reflect well on this vain boast of
forming ideas, we shall see that it is insolent and
absurd.</p>

<p>Let us remember that there is nothing in external
objects with the least analogy, the least relation,
to a feeling, an idea, a thought. Let an eye or an
ear be made by the best artisan in the world; the
eye will see nothing, the ear will hear nothing. It
is the same with our living body. The universal
principle of action does everything in us. He has
not made us an exception to the rest of nature.</p>

<p>Two experiences which are constantly repeated
during the course of our life, and of which I have
spoken elsewhere, will convince every thoughtful man
that our ideas, our wills, and our actions do not
belong to us.</p>

<p>The first is that no one knows, or can know, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
idea he will have at any minute, what desire he
will have, what word he will speak, what movement
his body will perform.</p>

<p>The second is that during sleep it is clear that
we have not the least share in what takes place in
our dreams. We grant that we are then mere
automata, on which an invisible power acts with a
force that is as real and powerful as it is incomprehensible.
This power fills the mind with ideas,
inspires desires, passions, reflections. It sets in
motion all the organs of the body. It has happened
at times that a mother has smothered, in a
restless dream, the new-born child that lay by her
side; that a man has killed his friend. How many
musicians have composed music during sleep? How
many young preachers have composed sermons
during their sleep?</p>

<p>If our life were equally divided between waking
and sleeping, instead of our usually spending a
third of our short career in sleep, and if we always
dreamed during sleep, it would then be evident that
half of our life did not depend on us. In any case,
assuming that we spend eight out of the twenty-four
hours in sleep, it is plain that a third of our
existence is beyond our control. Add to this infancy,
add all the time that is occupied in purely
animal functions, and see how much is left. You
will admit with surprise that at least half our life
does not belong to us at all. Then reflect how inconsistent
it would be if one half depended on us
and the other half did not.</p>

<p>Conclude, therefore, that the universal principle
of action does everything in us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span></p>

<p>Here the Jansenist interrupts me and says: “You
are a plagiarist; you have taken your doctrine from
the famous book, <cite>The Action of God on Created
Things, or Physical Premotion</cite>, by our great patriarch
Boursier.” I have said somewhere of Boursier
that he had dipped his pen in the inkpot of
the Deity. No, my friend; I have never received
anything from the Jansenists or the Molinists except
a strong aversion for sects, and some indifference
to their opinions. Boursier, taking God as
his model, knows precisely what was the nature of
Adam’s dream when God took a rib from his side
wherewith to make woman; he knows the nature of
his concupiscence, habitual grace, and actual grace.
He knows, with St. Augustine, that men and women
would have engendered children dispassionately in
the earthly paradise, just as one sows a field, without
any feeling of carnal pleasure. He is convinced
that Adam sinned only by distraction in the
earthly paradise. I know nothing about these
things, and am content to admire those who have
so splendid and profound a knowledge.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">X<br />
OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTION CALLED THE SOUL</h3>

<p>But, some centuries later in the history of man,
it came to be imagined that we have a soul which
acts of itself; and the idea has become so familiar
that we take it for a reality.</p>

<p>We talk incessantly of “the soul,” though we have
not the least idea of the meaning of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span></p>

<p>To some the soul means the life; to others it is
a small, frail image of ourselves, which goes, when
we die, to drink the waters of Acheron; to others it
is a harmony, a memory, an entelechy. In the end
it has been converted into a little being that is
not body, a breath that is not air; and of this word
“breath,” which corresponds to “spirit” in many
tongues, a kind of thing has been made which is
nothing at all.</p>

<p>Who can fail to see that men uttered, and still
utter, the word “soul” vaguely and without understanding,
as we utter the words “movement,”
“understanding,” “imagination,” “memory,” “desire,”
and “will”? There is no real being which
we call will, desire, memory, imagination, understanding,
or movement; but the real being called
man understands, imagines, remembers, desires,
wills, and moves. They are abstract terms, invented
for convenience of speech. I run, I sleep, I awake;
but there is no such physical reality as running,
sleep, or awakening. Neither sight, nor hearing, nor
touch, nor smell, nor taste, is a real being; I hear,
I see, I smell, I taste, I touch. And how could I
do this if the great being had not so disposed all
things; if the principle of action, the universal
cause&mdash;in one word, God&mdash;had not given us these
faculties?</p>

<p>We may be quite sure that there would be just
as much reason to grant the snail a hidden being
called a “free soul” as to grant it to man. The
snail has a will, desires, tastes, sensations, ideas,
and memory. It wishes to move towards the material
of its food or the object of its love. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
remembers it, has an idea of it, advances towards
it as quickly as it can; it knows pleasure and pain.
Yet you are not terrified when you are told that
the animal has not a spiritual soul; that God has
bestowed on it these gifts for a little time; that
he who moves the stars moves also the insect. But
when it comes to man you change your mind. This
poor animal seems to you so worthy of your respect&mdash;that
is to say, you are so proud&mdash;that you venture
to place in its frail body something that seems to
share the nature of God himself, yet something that
seems to you at times diabolical in the perversity
of its thoughts; something wise and foolish, good
and execrable, heavenly and infernal, invisible, immortal,
incomprehensible. And you have familiarised
yourself with this idea, as you have grown
accustomed to speak of movement, though there is
no such being as movement; as you use abstract
words, though there are no abstract beings.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XI<br />
EXAMINATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTION CALLED<br />
THE SOUL</h3>

<p>There is, nevertheless, a principle of action in
man. Yes, there is one everywhere. But can this
principle be anything else than a spring, a secret
first mover which is developed by the ever-active
first principle&mdash;a principle that is as powerful as
it is secret, as demonstrable as it is invisible, which
we have recognised as the essential cause in the
whole of nature?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span></p>

<p>If you create movement or ideas because you will
it, you are God for the time being; for you have all
the attributes of God&mdash;will, power, and creation.
Consider the absurdity into which you fall in making
yourself God.</p>

<p>You have to choose between these two alternatives:
either to be God whenever you will, or to
depend continually on God. The first is extravagant;
the second alone is reasonable.</p>

<p>If there were in our body a little god called “the
free soul,” which becomes so frequently a little
devil, this little god would have to be regarded
either as having been created from all eternity, or
as created at the moment of your conception, or
during your embryonic life, or at birth, or when you
begin to feel. All these positions are equally
ridiculous.</p>

<p>A little subordinate god, existing uselessly during
a past eternity and descending into a body that
often dies at birth, is the height of absurdity.</p>

<p>If this little god-soul is supposed to be created
at the moment of conception, we must consider the
master of nature, the being of beings, continually
occupied in watching assignations, attentive to every
intercourse of man and woman, ever ready to
despatch a sentient and thinking soul into a recess
between the entrails. A fine lodging for a little
god! When the mother brings forth a still-born
child, what becomes of the god-soul that had been
lodged in the abdomen? Whither has it returned?</p>

<p>The same difficulties and absurdities, equally ridiculous
and revolting, and found in connection with
each of the other suppositions. The idea of a soul,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
as it is usually and thoughtlessly conceived by
people, is one of the most foolish things that has
ever been devised.</p>

<p>How much more reasonable, more decent, more
respectful to the supreme being, more in harmony
with our nature, and therefore truer, is it not to say:</p>

<p>“We are machines made successively by the eternal
geometrician; machines made like all the other
animals, having the same organs, the same needs,
the same pleasures, the same pains; far superior to
all of them in many things, inferior to them in
others; having received from the great being a principle
of action which we cannot penetrate; receiving
everything, giving ourselves nothing; and a million
times more subject to him than the clay is to the
potter who moulds it”?</p>

<p>Once more, either man is a god or he is precisely
as I have described him.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XII<br />
WHETHER THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTION IN ANIMALS<br />
IS FREE</h3>

<p>There is a principle of action in man and in
every animal, just as there is in every machine;
and this first mover, this ultimate spring, is necessarily
eternally arranged by the master, otherwise
all would be chaos, and there would be no world.</p>

<p>Every animal, like every machine, necessarily and
irresistibly obeys the power that directs it. That
is evident, and sufficiently familiar. Every animal
is possessed of will, and one must be a fool to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
think that a dog following its master has not the
will to follow him. No doubt, it follows him irresistibly;
but it follows voluntarily. Does it follow
freely? Yes, if nothing prevents it; that is to
say, it can follow, it wills to follow, and it follows.
The freedom to follow is not in its will,
but in the power to walk that is given to it.
A nightingale wills to make its nest, and makes it
when it has found some moss. It had the freedom
to construct this cradle, just as it had freedom to
sing when it desires, and has not a chill. But was
it free to have the desire? Did it will to will to
make its nest? Had it that absurd “liberty of indifference”
which theologians would describe as follows:
“I neither will to make my nest nor the
contrary; it is a matter of complete indifference to
me; but I am going to will to make my nest solely
for the sake of willing, and without being determined
to do it in any way, merely to prove that
I am free”? Such is the absurdity we find taught
in the schools. If the nightingale could speak, it
would say to these doctors: “I am irresistibly determined
to nest, I will to nest, and I nest; you are
irresistibly determined to reason badly, and you
fulfil your destiny as I do mine.”</p>

<p>We will now see if man is free in any other sense.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XIII<br />
OF THE LIBERTY OF MAN, AND OF DESTINY</h3>

<p>A ball that drives another, a hunting-dog that
necessarily and voluntarily follows a stag, a stag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
that leaps a great ditch not less necessarily and
voluntarily, a roe that gives birth to another roe,
which will bring a third into the world&mdash;these
things are not more irresistibly determined than we
are to do all that we do. Let us remember always
how inconsistent and absurd it would be for one set
of things to be arranged and the other not.</p>

<p>Every present event is born of the past, and is
father of the future; otherwise the universe would
be quite other than it is, as Leibnitz has well said,
more correct in this than in his pre-established
harmony.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The eternal chain can be neither broken
nor entangled. The great being who necessarily
sustains it cannot let it hang uncertainly, nor
change it; for he would then no longer be the necessary
and immutable being, the being of beings; he
would be frail, inconstant, capricious; he would
belie his nature, and exist no longer.</p>

<p>Hence, an inevitable destiny is the law of nature,
as the whole of antiquity felt. The dread of depriving
man of some false liberty, robbing virtue
of its merit, and relieving crime of its horror, has
at times alarmed tender souls; but as soon as they
were enlightened they returned to this great truth,
that all things are enchained and necessary.</p>

<p>Man is free, we repeat, when he can do what he
wills to do; but he is not free to will; it is impossible
that he should will without cause. If this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
cause is not infallibly followed by its effect, it is
no cause. It would not be more absurd for a cloud
to say to the wind: “I do not wish to be driven
by you.” This truth can never injure morality.
Vice is always vice, as disease is always disease.
It will always be necessary to repress the wicked;
if they are determined to evil, we must reply that
they are equally predestined to chastisement.</p>

<p>Let us make these truths clearer.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XIV<br />
ABSURDITY OF WHAT IS CALLED LIBERTY OF<br />
INDIFFERENCE</h3>

<p>What an admirable spectacle is that of the eternal
destinies of all beings chained to the throne of the
maker of all worlds! I imagine a time when it is
not so, but a chimerical liberty makes every event
uncertain. I imagine that one of the substances
intermediate between us and the great being (there
may be millions of such beings) comes to consult
the eternal being on the destiny of some of the
enormous globes that stand at such vast distances
from us. The sovereign of nature would be forced
to reply: “I am not sovereign, I am not the great
necessary being; every little embryo is a master
of destiny. The whole world is free to will without
any other cause than the will. The future is
uncertain; everything depends on caprice. I can
foresee nothing. This great whole, which you regarded
as so regular, is but a vast anarchy in which
all is done without cause or reason. I shall be very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
careful not to say to you that such and such a
thing will happen; for then the wicked folk who
people the globes would do the contrary to what
I had foretold, if it were only from malice. Men
always dare to be jealous of their master, when he
has not a power so absolute as to take away the
very faculty of jealousy; they are pleased to see
him fall into a trap. I am but weak and ignorant.
Appeal to one more powerful and more gifted than
I.”</p>

<p>Possibly this allegory will avail more than any
other argument to arrest the partisans of this empty
liberty of indifference, if there still be any, and
those who labour to reconcile foreknowledge with
this liberty, and those who, in the university of
Salamanca or in Bedlam, still speak of medicinal
and concomitant grace.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XV<br />
OF EVIL AND, IN THE FIRST PLACE, THE DESTRUCTION<br />
OF BEASTS</h3>

<p>We have never had any idea of good and evil,
save in relation to ourselves. The sufferings of an
animal seem to us evils, because, being animals ourselves,
we feel that we should excite compassion if
the same were done to us. We should have the
same feeling for a tree if we were told that it suffered
torment when it was cut; and for a stone if
we learned that it suffers when it is dressed. But
we should pity the tree and the stone much less than
the animal, because they are less like us. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
we soon cease to be touched by the awful destiny
of the beasts that are intended for our table.
Children who weep at the death of the first chicken
they see killed laugh at the death of the second.</p>

<p>It is only too sure that the disgusting carnage of
our butcheries and kitchens does not seem to us an
evil. On the contrary, we regard this horror, pestilential
as it often is, as a blessing of the Lord; and
we still have prayers in which we thank him for
these murders. Yet what can be more abominable
than to feed constantly on corpses?</p>

<p>Not only do we spend our lives in killing, and
devouring what we have killed, but all the animals
slaughter each other; they are impelled to do so
by an invincible instinct. From the smallest insects
to the rhinoceros and the elephant, the earth
is but a vast battle-field, a world of carnage and
destruction. There is no animal that has not its
prey, and that, to capture it, does not employ some
means equivalent to the ruse and rage with which
the detestable spider entraps and devours the innocent
fly. A flock of sheep devours in an hour, as
it crops the grass, more insects than there are men
on the earth.</p>

<p>What is still more cruel is that in this horrible
scene of reiterated murder we perceive an evident
design to perpetuate all species by means of the
bloody corpses of their mutual enemies. The victims
do not expire until nature has carefully provided
for new representatives of the species. Everything
is born again to be murdered.</p>

<p>Yet I observe no moralist among us, nor any of
our fluent preachers or boasters, who has ever reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
in the least on this frightful habit, which
has become part of our nature. We have to go back
to the pious Porphyry and the sympathetic Pythagoreans
to find those who would shame us for our
bloody gluttony; or we must travel to the land of
the Brahmans. Our monks, the caprice of whose
founders has bade them renounce the flesh, are
murderers of soles and turbots, if not of partridges
and quails. Neither among the monks, nor in the
Council of Trent, nor in the assemblies of the clergy,
nor in our academies, has this universal butchery
ever been pronounced an evil. There has been no
more thought given to it in the councils of the
clergy than in our public-houses.</p>

<p>Hence the great being is justified of these butcheries
in our eyes; or, indeed, we are his accomplices.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XVI<br />
OF EVIL IN THE ANIMAL CALLED MAN</h3>

<p>So much for the beasts; let us come to man. If
it be not an evil that the only being on earth that
knows God by his thoughts should be unhappy in
his thoughts; if it be not an evil that this worshipper
of the Deity should be almost always unjust
and suffering, should know virtue and commit crime,
should so often deceive and be deceived, and be the
victim or the executioner of his fellows, etc.; if all
that be not a frightful evil, I know not where evil
is to be found.</p>

<p>Beasts and men suffer almost without ceasing;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
men suffer the more because, not only is the gift
of thought often a source of torture, but this faculty
of thinking always makes them fear death, which
the beast cannot foresee. Man is a very miserable
being, having but a few hours of rest, a few moments
of satisfaction, and a long series of days of
sorrow in his short life. Everybody admits and says
this; and it is true.</p>

<p>They who have protested that all is well are
charlatans. Shaftesbury, who set the fashion in this,
was a most unhappy man. I have seen Bolingbroke
torn with grief and rage; and Pope, whom he induced
to put this miserable joke into verse, was one
of the most pitiable men I have ever known, misshapen
in body, unbalanced in temperament, always
ill and a burden to himself, harassed by a hundred
enemies until his last moment. At least let us have
happy beings saying that all is well.</p>

<p>If by all is well it is merely meant that a man’s
head is happily placed above his shoulders, so that
his eyes are better situated beside the root of his
nose than behind his ears, we may assent. All is
well in that sense. The laws of physics and mathematics
are very well observed in his structure. A
man who saw the beautiful Anne Boleyn, or the still
more beautiful Mary Stuart, in her youth, would
have said that it was well; would he have said it
on seeing them die by the hand of the executioner?
Would he have said it on seeing the grandson of the
beautiful Mary Stuart perish in the same way in
the heart of his capital? Would he have said it on
seeing the great-grandson even more miserable,
because he lived longer?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span></p>

<p>Glance over the human race, if it be but from the
prescriptions of Sylla to the Irish massacres.</p>

<p>Behold these battlefields, strewn by imbeciles with
the corpses of other imbeciles, whom they have slain
with a substance born of the experiments of a monk.
See these arms, these legs, these bloody brains, and
all these scattered limbs; it is the fruit of a quarrel
between two ignorant ministers, neither of whom
would dare to open his mouth in the presence of
Newton, Locke, or Halley; or of some ridiculous
quarrel between two forward women. Enter the
neighbouring hospital, where are gathered those who
are not yet dead. Their life is taken from them by
fresh torments, and men make a fortune out of
them, keeping a register of the victims who are dissected
alive, at so much a day, under the pretext
of healing them.</p>

<p>See these other men, dressed as comedians, earning
a little money by singing, in a foreign language,
a very obscure and insipid song, to thank the author
of nature for this horrible outrage done to nature;
and then tell me calmly that all is well.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Say the
word, if you dare, in connection with Alexander VI.
and Julius II.; say it over the ruins of a hundred
towns that have been swallowed up by earthquakes,
and amid the twelve millions of Americans who are
being assassinated, in twelve million ways, to punish
them for not being able to understand in Latin a
papal bull that the monks have read to them. Say
it to-day, the 24th of August, 1772; a day on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
the pen trembles in my fingers, the two-hundredth
anniversary of the massacre of St. Bartholomew.
Pass from these innumerable theatres of carnage to
the equally unnumbered retreats of sorrow that
cover the earth, to that swarm of diseases which
slowly devour so many poor wretches while they yet
live; think of that frightful ravage of nature which
poisons the human race in its source, and associates
the most abominable of plagues with the most necessary
of pleasures. See that despised king Henry
III., and that mediocre leader the Duke of Mayenne,
struck down with the small-pox while they are
waging civil war; and that insolent descendant of a
Florentine merchant, Gondi, and Retz, the priest,
archbishop of Paris, preaching with sword in hand
and body diseased. To complete this true and horrible
picture, fancy yourself amid the floods and volcanoes
that have so often devastated so many parts
of the world; amid the leprosy and the plague that
have swept it. And do you who read this recall all
that you have suffered, admit that evil exists, and
do not add to so many miseries and horrors the wild
absurdity of denying them.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XVII<br />
ROMANCES INVENTED TO EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN OF EVIL</h3>

<p>Of a hundred peoples who have sought the cause
of physical and moral evil, the Hindoos are the first
whose romantic imaginations are known to us.
They are sublime, if the word “sublime” be taken
to mean “high.” Evil, according to the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
Brahmans, comes of a quarrel that once took place
in the highest heavens, between the faithful and the
jealous angels. The rebels were cast out of heaven
into Ondera for millions of ages. But the great
being pardoned them at the end of a few thousand
years; they were turned into men, and they brought
upon the earth the evil that they had engendered
in the empyræan. We have elsewhere described at
length this ancient fable, the source of all fables.</p>

<p>It was finely imitated by gifted nations, and
grossly reproduced by barbarians. Nothing, indeed,
is more spiritual and agreeable than the story of
Pandora and her box. If Hesiod has had the merit
of inventing this allegory, I think it as superior
to Homer as Homer is to Lycophron.</p>

<p>This box of Pandora, containing all the evils that
have issued from it, seems to have all the charm of
the most striking and delicate allusions. Nothing
is more enchanting than this origin of our sufferings.
But there is something still more admirable
in the story of Pandora. It has a very high merit,
which seems to have escaped notice: it is that no
one was ever commanded to believe it.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XVIII<br />
OF THE SAME ROMANCES, IMITATED BY BARBARIC<br />
NATIONS</h3>

<p>In the regions of Chaldæa and Syria the barbarians
also had their legends of the origin of evil.
Among one of these nations in the neighbourhood
of the Euphrates it was said that a serpent, meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
a burdened and thirsty ass, asked what the ass
carried. “The recipe of immortality,” said the ass;
“God has bestowed it upon man, who has laid it
on my back. He follows me, but is far off, because
he has only two legs. I die of thirst; prithee tell
me where there is a stream.” The serpent led the
ass to water, and, while it drank, stole the recipe.
Hence it is that the serpent is immortal, while man
is subject to death and all the pains that precede it.</p>

<p>You will observe that the serpent was thought by
all peoples to be immortal because it cast its skin.
If it changed its skin, this must have been in order
to become young again. I have spoken elsewhere
of this naïve theology; but it is well to bring it
once more to the notice of the reader, in order to
show him the nature of this venerable antiquity, in
which serpents and asses played such important
parts.</p>

<p>The Syrians rose higher. They told that man and
woman, having been created in heaven, desired one
day to eat a certain cake; and that they then asked
an angel to show them the place of retirement. The
angel pointed to the earth. They went thither; and
God, to punish them for their gluttony, left them
there. Let us also leave them there, and their dinner
and their ass and their serpent. These inconceivable
puerilities of ancient Syria are not worth a moment’s
notice. The detestable fables of an obscure
people should be excluded from a serious discussion.</p>

<p>Let us return from these miserable legends to the
great saying of Epicurus, which has so long alarmed
the whole earth, and to which there is no answer
but a sigh: “Either God wished to prevent evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
and could not do so; or he was able to do so, and
did not wish.”</p>

<p>A thousand bachelors and doctors of divinity have
fired the arrows of the school at this unshakeable
rock; in this terrible shelter have the Atheists taken
refuge. Yet the Atheist must admit that there is
in nature an active, intelligent, necessary, eternal
principle, and that from this principle comes all that
we call good and evil. Let us discuss the point with
the Atheist.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XIX<br />
DISCOURSE OF AN ATHEIST ON ALL THIS</h3>

<p>An Atheist says to me: It has been proved, I
admit, that there is an eternal and necessary principle.
But from the fact that it is necessary I
infer that all that is derived from it is necessary;
you have been compelled to admit this yourself.
Since everything is necessary, evil is as inevitable
as good. The great wheel of the ever-turning machine
crushes all that comes in its way. I have no
need of an intelligent being who can do nothing of
himself, and who is as much a slave to his destiny
as I am to mine. If he existed, I should have too
much with which to reproach him. I should be
obliged to call him either feeble or wicked. I would
rather deny his existence than be discourteous to
him. Let us get through this miserable life as well
as we can, without reference to a fantastic being
whom no one has ever seen, and to whom it would
matter little, if he existed, whether we believed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
him or not. What I think of him can no more
affect him, supposing that he exists, than what he
thinks of me, of which I am ignorant, affects me.
There is no relation, no connection, no interest between
him and me. Either there is no such being
or he is an utter stranger to me. Let us do as nine
hundred and ninety-nine mortals out of a thousand
do; they work, generate, eat, drink, sleep, suffer,
and die, without speaking of metaphysics, or knowing
that there is such a thing.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XX<br />
DISCOURSE OF A MANICHÆAN</h3>

<p>A Manichæan, hearing the Atheist, says to him:
You are mistaken. Not only is there a God, but
there are necessarily two. It has been fully proved
that the universe is arranged intelligently, and there
is an intelligent principle in nature; but it is impossible
that this intelligent principle, which is the
author of good, should also be the author of evil.
Evil must have its own God. Zoroaster was the
first to proclaim this great truth, about two thousand
years ago; and two other Zoroasters came
afterwards to confirm it. The Parsees have always
followed, and still follow, this excellent doctrine.
Some wretched people or other, called the Jews, at
that time in bondage to us, learned a little of our
science, together with the names of Satan and Knatbul.
They recognised God and the devil; and the
devil was so powerful, in the opinion of this poor
little people, that one day, when God had descended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
into their country, the devil took him up into a
mountain. Admit two gods, therefore; the world
is large enough to hold them and find sufficient
work for them.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XXI<br />
DISCOURSE OF A PAGAN</h3>

<p>Then a Pagan arose, and said: If we are to
admit two gods, I do not see what prevents us from
worshipping a thousand. The Greeks and Romans,
who were superior to you, were polytheists. It will
be necessary some day to return to the admirable
doctrine that peoples the universe with genii and
deities; it is assuredly the only system which explains
everything&mdash;the only one in which there is
no contradiction. If your wife betrays you, Venus
is the cause of it. If you are robbed, put the blame
on Mercury. If you lose an arm or a leg in battle,
it was arranged by Mars. So much for the evil.
In regard to the good, not only do Apollo, Ceres,
Pomona, Bacchus, and Flora load you with presents,
but occasionally the same Mars will rid you of your
enemies, the same Venus will find you mistresses, the
same Mercury may pour all your neighbours’ gold
into your coffers, provided your hand comes to the
assistance of his wand.</p>

<p>It was much easier for these gods to agree in
governing the universe than it seems to be to this
Manichæan to reconcile his Ormuzd, the benevolent,
and Ahriman, the malevolent, two mortal enemies,
so as to maintain both light and darkness. Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
eyes see better than one. Hence all the poets of
antiquity are continually calling councils of the
gods. How can you suppose that one god is enough
to see to all the details of life on Saturn and all
the business of the star Capella? What! You
imagine that everything on our globe, except in the
houses of the King of Prussia and the Pope Ganganelli,
is regulated by councils, and there is no council
in heaven! There is no better way of deciding
things than by a majority of votes. The deity always
acts in the wisest way. The Theist seems to
me, in comparison with a Pagan, to be like a Prussian
soldier entering the territory of Venice; he is
charmed with the excellence of the government.
“The king of this country,” he says, “must work
from morning to night. I greatly pity him.”
“There is no king,” people reply; “we are governed
by a council.”</p>

<p>Here are the true principles of our ancient
religion.</p>

<p>The great being known as Jehovah or Yaa among
the Phœnicians, the Jove of other Asiatic nations,
the Jupiter of the Romans, the Zeus of the Greeks,
is the sovereign of gods and men.</p>

<p class="center"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deum sator atque hominum rex.</i></p>

<p>The master of the whole of nature, to whom nothing
in the whole range of being approaches.</p>

<p class="center"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cui nihil simile, nec secundum.</i></p>

<p>The animating spirit of the universe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jovis omnia plena.</i></p>

<p>All the ideas that one may have of God are enfolded
in this fine verse of the ancient Orpheus,
quoted throughout antiquity, and repeated in all
the mysteries.</p>

<p class="center">εἶς ἔστ’, αὐτογενὴς, ἑνὸς ἔkγονα πάντα τέτέυκται.</p>

<p class="center">“He is One, self-born, and all was born of One.”</p>

<p>But he confides to the subordinate gods the care
of the stars, the elements, the seas, and the bowels
of the earth. His wife, who represents the expanse
of space that he fills, is Juno. His daughter,
who is eternal wisdom, his word, is Minerva. His
other daughter, Venus, is the lover of the poetical
generation. She is the mother of love, inflaming all
sensitive beings, uniting them, reproducing by the
attraction of pleasure all that necessity devotes to
death. All the gods have made presents to mortals.
Ceres has given them corn, Bacchus the vine, Pomona
fruit; Apollo and Mercury have taught them the
arts.</p>

<p>The great Zeus, the great Demiourgos, had made
the planets and the earth. He had brought men
and animals into existence on our planet. The first
man was, according to the account of Berosus,
Alora, father of Sares, grandfather of Alaspara,
who begot Amenon, of whom was born Metalare,
who was the father of Daon, father of Everodao,
father of Amphis, father of Osiarte, father of the
famous Sixutros or Xixutrus, King of Chaldæa,
under whom occurred the well-known deluge, which
the Greeks called “the deluge of Ogyges”; a flood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
of which the precise date is still uncertain, as is
that of the other great inundation, which swallowed
up the isle of Atlantis and part of Greece about six
thousand years ago.</p>

<p>We have another theogony in Sanchoniathon, without
a deluge. Those of the Hindoos, Chinese, and
Egyptians are very different again.</p>

<p>All events of antiquity are lost in a dark night;
but the existence and blessings of Jupiter are
clearer than the light of the sun. The hero who,
stirred by his example, did good to men was known
by the holy name of Dionysos, son of God. Bacchus,
Hercules, Perseus, and Romulus also received this
divine name. Some went so far even as to say that
the divine virtue was communicated to their mothers.
The Greeks and Romans, although they were somewhat
debauched, as are to-day all Christians of a
sociable nature, rather drunken, like the canons of
Germany, and given to unnatural vices, like the
French king Henry III. and his Nogaret, were very
religious. They offered sacrifice and incense, walked
in processions, and fasted.</p>

<p>But everything becomes corrupt in time. Religion
changed. The splendid name of Son of God&mdash;that
is to say, just and benevolent&mdash;was afterwards
given to the most unjust and cruel of men,
because they were powerful. The ancient piety,
which was humane, was displaced by superstition,
which is always cruel. Virtue had dwelt on the
earth as long as the fathers of families were the only
priests, and offered to Jupiter and the immortal
gods the first of their fruits and flowers; but all
this was changed when the priests began to shed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
blood and wanted to share with the gods. They
did share in truth; they took the offerings, and left
the smoke to the gods. You know how our enemies
succeeded in crushing us, adopting our earlier
morals, rejecting our bloody sacrifices, calling men
to the Church, making a party for themselves among
the poor until such time as they should capture the
rich. They took our place. We are annihilated,
they triumph; but, corrupted at length like ourselves,
they need a great reform, which I wish them
with all my heart.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XXII<br />
DISCOURSE OF A JEW</h3>

<p>Take no notice of this idolatrous Pagan who would
turn God into a Dutch president, and offer us
subordinate gods like members of parliament.</p>

<p>My religion, being above nature, can have no
resemblance to others.</p>

<p>The first difference between them and us is that
the source of our religion was hidden for a very
long time from the rest of the earth. The dogmas
of our fathers were buried, like ourselves, in a little
country about a hundred and fifty miles long and
sixty in width. In this well dwelt the truth that
was unknown to the whole world, until certain
rebels, going forth from among us, took from it
the name of “truth” in the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, and Nero; and presently boasted
that they were establishing a new truth.</p>

<p>The Chaldæans recognised Alora as their father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
as you know. The Phœnicians descended from a
man named Origen, according to Sanchoniathon.
The Greeks had their Prometheus; the Atlantids
had their Ouran, called in Greek Ouranos. I say
nothing of the Chinese, Hindoos, or Scythians. We
had our Adam, of whom nobody ever heard except
our nation, and we only very late. It was not the
Ephaistos of the Greeks, known to the Latins as
Vulcan, who invented the art of using metals; it
was Tubalcain. The whole of the West was astonished
to hear, under Constantine, that it was not
Bacchus to whom the nations owed the use of wine,
but Noah, whose name none knew in the whole
Roman Empire, any more than they knew the names
of his ancestors, which were unknown throughout
the earth. The anecdote was learned only from our
Bible, when it was translated into Greek; it began
to spread about that time. The sun was then seen
to be no longer the source of light; the light was
created before the sun, and separated from the
darkness, as the waters were separated from the
waters. Woman was made from a rib, which God
himself took out of a sleeping man, without awakening
him, and without causing his descendants to be
short of a rib.</p>

<p>The Tigris, Araxis, Euphrates, and Nile all had
their source in the same garden. We do not know
where the garden was, but its existence is proved,
because the gate was guarded by a cherub.</p>

<p>Animals speak. The eloquence of a serpent was
fatal to the whole human race. A Chaldæan prophet
conversed with his ass.</p>

<p>God, the creator of all men, is not the father of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
all men, but of one family alone. This family,
always wandering, left the fertile land of Chaldæa
to wander for some time in the neighbourhood of
Sodom; from this journey it acquired an incontestable
right to the city of Jerusalem, which was not
yet in existence.</p>

<p>Our family increases at such a rate that seventy
men produce, at the end of two hundred and fifty
years, six hundred and thirty thousand men bearing
arms; counting the women, children, and old
men, that amounts to about three millions. These
three millions live in a small canton of Egypt which
cannot maintain twenty thousand people. For their
advantage God puts to death in one night all the
first-born of the Egyptians; and, after this massacre,
instead of giving Egypt to his people, God
puts himself at their head to fly with them dry-foot
across the sea, and cause a whole generation of
Jews to die in the desert.</p>

<p>We have seven times been in slavery in spite of
the appalling miracles that God works for us every
day, causing the moon to stand still in midday, and
also the sun. Ten out of twelve of our tribes
perished for ever. The other two are scattered and
in misery. We have always prophets, nevertheless.
God descends continually among our people alone,
and mingles only with us. He appears constantly
to these prophets, his sole confidants and favourites.</p>

<p>He goes to visit Addo or Iddo or Jeddo, and
commands him to travel without eating. The prophet
thinks that God has ordered him to eat that
he may walk better; he eats, and forthwith he is
eaten by a lion (1 <cite>Kings</cite> xiii.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span></p>

<p>God commands Isaiah to go forth among his
fellow-citizens in a most unbecoming state of attire,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">discoopertis natibus</i> (<cite>Isaiah</cite> xx.).</p>

<p>God orders Jeremiah to put a yoke on his neck
and a saddle on his back (<em>ch.</em> xxvii. according to
the Hebrews).</p>

<p>He orders Ezekiel to have himself bound, to eat
a parchment book, to lie for two hundred and ninety
days on the right side and forty days on the left
side, and then to eat filth with his bread.</p>

<p>He commands Hosea to take a prostitute and have
three children by her; then he commands him to
pay an adulterous woman and have children by
her.</p>

<p>Add to all these prodigies an uninterrupted series
of massacres, and you will see that among us all
things are divine, because nothing is in accordance
with what men call decent laws.</p>

<p>Unhappily, we were not well known to other
nations until we were nearly annihilated. It was
our enemies, the Christians, who made us known
when they despoiled us. They built up their system
with material taken from a bad Greek translation
of our Bible. They insult and oppress us to
this day; but our turn will come. It is well known
how we will triumph at the end of the world, when
there will be no one left on the earth.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XXIII<br />
DISCOURSE OF A TURK</h3>

<p>When the Jew had finished, a Turk, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
smoked throughout the meeting, washed his mouth,
recited the formula “Allah Illah,” and said to
me:</p>

<p>I have listened to all these dreamers. I have
gathered that thou art a dog of a Christian, but
thou pleasest me because thou seemest liberal, and
art in favour of gratuitous predestination. I believe
thou art a sensible man, assuming that thou
dost agree with me.</p>

<p>Most of thy dogs of Christians have spoken only
folly about our Mohammed. A certain Baron de
Tott, a man of much ability and geniality, who did
us great service in the last war, induced me some
time ago to read a book of one of your most learned
men, named Grotius, entitled <cite>The Truth of the
Christian Religion</cite>. This Grotius accuses our great
Mohammed of forcing men to believe that a pigeon
spoke in his ear, that a camel conversed with him
during the night, and that he had put half the
moon in his sleeve. If the most learned of your
Christ-worshippers can write such asinine stuff, what
must I think of the others?</p>

<p>No, Mohammed did none of these village-miracles,
of which people speak only a hundred years after
the supposed event. He wrought none of those
miracles which Baron de Tott read to me in the
<cite>Golden Legend</cite>, written at Geneva. He wrought
none of your miracles in the manner of St. Médard,
which have been so much derided in Europe, and
at which a French ambassador has laughed so much
in our presence. The miracles of Mohammed were
victories. God has shown that he was a favourite
by subjecting half our hemisphere to him. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
not unknown for two whole centuries. He triumphed
as soon as he was persecuted.</p>

<p>His religion is wise, severe, chaste, and humane.
Wise, because it knows not the folly of giving God
associates, and it has no mysteries; severe, because
it prohibits games of chance, and wine, and strong
drinks, and orders prayer five times a day; chaste,
because it reduces to four the prodigious number
of spouses who shared the bed of all oriental princes;
humane, because it imposes on us almsgiving more
rigorously than the journey to Mecca.</p>

<p>Add tolerance to all these marks of truth. Reflect
that we have in the city of Stamboul alone
more than a hundred thousand Christians of all
sects, who carry out all the ceremonies of their
cults in peace, and live so happily under the shelter
of our laws that they never deign to visit you, while
you crowd to our imperial gate.</p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XXIV<br />
DISCOURSE OF A THEIST</h3>

<p>A Theist then asked permission to speak, and
said:</p>

<p>Everyone has his own opinion, good or bad. I
should be sorry to distress any good man. First,
I ask pardon of the Atheist; but it seems to me
that, compelled as he is to admit an excellent design
in the order of the universe, he is bound to admit
an intelligence that has conceived and carried out
this design. It is enough, it seems to me, that, when
the Atheist lights a candle, he admits that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
for the purpose of giving light. It seems to me that
he should also grant that the sun was made to
illumine our part of the universe. We must not
dispute about such probable matters.</p>

<p>The Atheist should yield the more graciously
since, being a good man, he has nothing to fear
from a master who has no interest in injuring him.
He may quite safely admit a God; he will not pay
a penny the more in taxes, and will not live less
comfortably.</p>

<p>As to you, my pagan friend, I submit that you
are rather late with your project of restoring polytheism.
For that Maxentius ought to have defeated
Constantine, or else Julian ought to have lived
thirty years longer.</p>

<p>I confess that I see no impossibility in the existence
of several beings far superior to us, each of
whom would superintend some heavenly body. Indeed,
it would give me some pleasure to prefer your
Naiads, Dryads, Sylvans, Graces, and Loves to St.
Fiacre, St. Pancratius, Sts. Crepin and Crepinien,
St. Vitus, St. Cunegonde, or St. Marjolaine. But,
really, one must not multiply things without need;
and as a single intelligence suffices for the regulation
of the world, I will stop at that until other
powers show me that they share its rule.</p>

<p>As to you, my Manichæan friend, you seem to
me a duellist, very fond of fighting. I am a peaceful
man, and do not like to find myself between
two rivals who are ever at war. Your Ormuzd is
enough for me; you can keep your Ahriman.</p>

<p>I shall always be somewhat embarrassed in regard
to the origin of evil; but I suppose that the good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Ormuzd, who made everything, could not do better.
I cannot offend him if I say to him: You have
done all that a powerful, wise, and good being could
do. It is not your fault if your works cannot be
as good and perfect as yourself. Imperfection is
one of the essential differences between you and
your creatures. You could not make gods; it was
necessary that, since men possessed reason, they
should display folly, just as there must be friction
in every machine. Each man has his dose of imperfection
and folly, from the very fact that you
are perfect and wise. He must not be always happy,
because you are always happy. It seems to me that
a collection of muscles, nerves, and veins cannot last
more than eighty or a hundred years at the most,
and that you must be for ever. It seems to me
impossible that an animal, necessarily compacted
of desires and wills, should not at times wish to
serve his own purpose by doing evil to his neighbour.
You only never do evil. Lastly, there is necessarily
so great a distance between you and your works
that the good is in you, and the evil must be in
them.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>As for me, imperfect as I am, I thank you for
giving me a short span of existence, and especially
for not having made me a professor of theology.</p>

<p>That is not at all a bad compliment. God could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
not be angry with me, seeing that I do not wish
to displease him. In fine, I feel that, if I do no
evil to my brethren and respect my master, I shall
have nothing to fear, either from Ahriman, or Cerberus
and the Furies, or Satan, or Knatbull, or St.
Fiacre and St. Crepin; and I shall end my days in
peace and the pursuit of philosophy.</p>

<p>I come now to you, Mr. Abrabanel and Mr. Benjamin.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
You seem to me to be the maddest of the
lot. The Kaffirs, Hottentots, and blacks of New
Guinea are more reasonable and decent beings than
your Jewish ancestors were. You have surpassed
all nations in exorbitant legends, bad conduct, and
barbarism. You are paying for it; it is your destiny.
The Roman Empire has fallen; the Parsees,
your former masters, are scattered. The Armenians
sell rags, and occupy a low position in the whole
of Asia. There is no trace left of the ancient
Egyptians. Why should you be a power?</p>

<p>As to you, my Turkish friend, I advise you to
come to terms as soon as possible with the Empress
of Russia, if you wish to keep what you have
usurped in Europe. I am willing to believe that
the victories of Mohammed, son of Abdala, were
miracles; but Catherine II. also works miracles.
Take care that she do not some day perform the
miracle of sending you back to the deserts from
which you came. In particular, continue to be tolerant;
it is the true way to please the being of beings,
who is alike the father of Turks and Russians,
Chinese and Japanese, black and yellow man, and
of the whole of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span></p>


<h3 class="allsmcap">XXV<br />
DISCOURSE OF A CITIZEN</h3>

<p>When the Theist had spoken, a man arose and
said: I am a citizen, and therefore the friend of all
these gentlemen. I will not dispute with any of
them. I wish only to see them all united in the
design of aiding and loving each other, in making
each other happy, in so far as men of such different
opinions can love each other, and contribute to each
other’s happiness, which is as difficult as it is
necessary.</p>

<p>To attain this end, I advise them first to cast in
the fire all the controversial books which come their
way, especially those of the Jesuits; and also the
ecclesiastical gazette, and all other pamphlets which
are but the fuel of the civil war of fools.</p>

<p>Next, each of our brethren, whether Theist, Turk,
Pagan, Greek Christian, Latin Christian, Anglican,
Scandinavian, Jew, or Atheist, will read attentively
several pages of Cicero’s <cite>De Officiis</cite>, or of Montaigne,
and some of La Fontaine’s <cite>Fables</cite>.</p>

<p>The reading of these works insensibly disposes
men to that concord which theologians have hitherto
held in horror. Their minds being thus prepared,
every time that a Christian and a Mussulman meet
an Atheist they will say to him: “Dear brother,
may heaven enlighten you”; and the Atheist will
reply: “When I am converted I shall come and
thank you.”</p>

<p>The Theist will give two kisses to the Manichæan
woman in honour of the two principles. The Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
and Roman woman will give three to each member
of the other sects, even the Quakers and Jansenists.
The Socinians need only embrace once, seeing that
those gentlemen believe there is only one person
in God; but this embrace will be equal to three
when it is performed in good faith.</p>

<p>We know that an Atheist can live very cordially
with a Jew, especially if the Jew does not charge
more than eight per cent. in lending him money;
but we have no hope of ever seeing a lively friendship
between a Calvinist and a Lutheran. All that
we require of the Calvinist is that he return the
salute of the Lutheran with some affection, and do
not follow the example of the Quakers, who do
reverence to nobody; but the Calvinists have not
their candour.</p>

<p>We urge the primitive folk called Quakers to
marry their sons to the daughters of the Theists
who are known as Socinians, as these young ladies,
being nearly all the daughters of priests, are very
poor. Not only will it be a very good deed before
God and men, but these marriages will produce a
new race, which, representing the first years of the
Christian Church, will be very useful to the human
race.</p>

<p>These preliminaries being settled, if any quarrel
occur between members of two different sects, they
must never choose a theologian as arbitrator, for
he would infallibly eat the oyster and leave them
the shells.</p>

<p>To maintain the established peace nothing shall
be offered for sale, either by a Greek to a Turk, a
Turk to a Jew, or a Roman to a Roman, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
what pertains to food, clothing, lodging, or pleasure.
They shall not sell circumcision, or baptism, or
burial, or permission to turn round the black stone
in the <em>caaba</em>, or to harden one’s knees before Our
Lady of Loretto, who is still blacker.</p>

<p>In all the disputes that shall arise it is expressly
forbidden to treat any person as a dog, however
angry one may be&mdash;unless indeed we treat dogs as
men when they steal our dinner or bite us.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Probably adopting a name which is known to have
existed among his mother’s ancestors. But it is curious
that “Voltaire” is an anagram of his name&mdash;Arouet

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The condition of Toulouse will be best understood from
a description of these processions which Voltaire gives
elsewhere. In front walked the shoemakers, bearing the
authentic head of a prince of Peloponnesus, who had been
Bishop of Toulouse <em>during the lifetime</em> of Christ. After
them came the slaters, carrying the bones of the fourteen
thousand children slain by Herod; the old-clothes dealers,
with a piece of the dress of the Virgin Mary; and the
tailors, with the relics of St. Peter and St. Paul.&mdash;J. M.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> I know only two instances in history of fathers being
charged with killing their children on account of religion.
The first is the case of the father of St. Barbara, or Ste.
Barbe. He had had two windows made in his bath-room.
Barbara, in his absence, had a third made, to honour the
Holy Trinity. She made the sign of the cross on the
marble columns <em>with the tip of her finger</em>, and it was
deeply engraved on the stone. Her son came angrily
upon her, sword in hand; but she escaped through a
mountain, which opened to receive her. The father went
round the mountain and caught her. She was stripped
and flogged, but God clothed her in a white cloud. In the
end her father cut off her head. So says the <cite>Flower of
the Saints</cite>.</p>

<p>The second case is that of Prince Hermenegild. He
rebelled against his father, the king, gave him battle (in
584), and was beaten and killed by an officer. As his
father was an Arian, he was regarded as a martyr.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Voltaire nobly conceals his work. It was he who, from
his exile near Geneva, sent for young Calas, made searching
inquiries in Toulouse, and instructed the Parisian
lawyers to appeal. He enlisted the interest of English
and French visitors at Geneva, and there was “a rivalry
in generosity between the two nations.” After a long
struggle with the Toulouse authorities the sentence was
reversed at Paris amid general enthusiasm. The King very
generously pensioned the widow and the other victims.&mdash;J.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> Ch. 25. Voltaire has in this followed ecclesiastical
custom. The word in Suetonius is not “Christo,” but
“Chresto,” and therefore the passage reads, in English:
“Claudius expelled the Jews from Rome for their constant
disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus.” As
Chrestus was not an uncommon name at Rome, there is
no need to apply the passage to Christ in any way.&mdash;J. M.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> I omit many of the lengthy notes, in which Voltaire,
with veiled irony and a bland pretence of orthodoxy&mdash;for
the reason of which see the Introduction,&mdash;throws doubt
on the persecutions. The freer scholarship of the nineteenth
century has so far justified his scepticism that
few are now interested in the fairy tales of the early
“persecutions.” There was only one general repression
of the Christians, under Diocletian. See the latest editions
of Gibbon, and Robertson’s <cite>Short History of Christianity</cite>
(pp. 130-140).&mdash;J. M.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> Voltaire’s irony and pretence of orthodoxy must again,
as in so many places, be taken into account. You do

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> If they had been content to preach and write, they
would probably have been left in peace; but the refusal
to take the oaths, in a constitution in which much use
was made of oaths, exposed them to suspicion. The refusal
to take part publicly in the feasts in honour of the
emperors was a sort of crime at a time when the empire
was constantly stirred by revolutions. The insults they
offered to the established cult were punished with severity
and barbarism, and it was an age of rough and violent
ways.</p>

There was no general persecution under Domitian, but
certain high officials suffered, like the rest of Rome, from
his excessive suspicion.&mdash;J. M.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> Voltaire, who knew only the late history of Egypt,
gives a lengthy note to explain his disdain. Archæological
research has altered all that.&mdash;J. M.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> Not wholly unknown. We know that the mother of
Galerius, an ignorant peasant, was stung by the insults
of Christian officers in the palace, and inflamed her son,
who persuaded Diocletian to take action. The action was
mild at first; but Christians tore down the imperial edict,
and the palace was twice set on fire. Then Diocletian
yielded.&mdash;J. M.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> The persecution under Diocletian began in 303.&mdash;J. M.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> The Jesuit Busenbaum, edited by the Jesuit La Croix,
says that “it is lawful to kill a prince excommunicated
by the Pope, in whatever country he may be found, because
the universe belongs to the Pope, and he who accepts
this commission does a charitable deed.” This
proposition, drawn up in the antechambers of hell, has
done more than anything to raise France against the
Jesuits. [They were expelled from France in 1767.&mdash;J. M.].
They endeavoured to justify themselves by pointing
out that the same conclusions are found in St. Thomas
and other Dominicans. As a matter of fact, St. Thomas
of Aquin, the “angelic doctor” and “interpreter of the
divine will”&mdash;such are his titles,&mdash;says that an apostate
prince loses his right to the crown, and should no longer
be obeyed (Bk. II., Part II., quest. xii.); that the Church
may punish him with death; that the Emperor Julian was
tolerated only because the Christians were weak (same
passage); that it is right to kill any heretic (same place,
questions xi. and xii.); that those are laudable who free
a people from a tyrannical prince, etc. We must admit
that Gerson, Chancellor of the University, went farther
than St. Thomas, and the Franciscan Jean Petit much
farther than Gerson.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> Voltaire’s eagerness to show the tolerance of the Jews
is purely paradoxical and ironical. His sole object in this
section is to expose the crudities of the Old Testament,
under the cloak of orthodox theological reasoning. Hence
he omits the savage laws of <cite>Deuteronomy</cite> against foreign
cults.&mdash;J. M.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> It may be useful to recall that, as earlier pages show,
Voltaire did not believe in the “next world.” Much of
the phrasing of this part is, when it is not ironical, merely

<p><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> A pun of which the point is lost in English. The
French phrase, to make a man “swallow the gudgeon,”
means to “gull” a man. Voltaire turns the “two little
fishes” of the gospel into gudgeons to accommodate his
joke.&mdash;J. M.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> The indictment is too severe. The later years of Constantine
were marked by silly extravagance, but not debauch.
The execution of his father-in-law was justified.
His (partial) acceptance of Christianity was earlier than
Voltaire supposes, and there is no serious ground for
suggesting large payments of money. But it is now beyond
question that he put his brother-in-law (Licinius) to
death treacherously, had his wife, son, and nephew murdered,
and greatly degenerated in later life.&mdash;J. M.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
